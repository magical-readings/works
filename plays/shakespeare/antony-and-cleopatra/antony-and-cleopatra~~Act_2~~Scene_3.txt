          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants
    MARK ANTONY
        1  The world and my great office will sometimes
        2  Divide me from your bosom.
    OCTAVIA
        3  All which time
        4  Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
        5  To them for you.
    MARK ANTONY
        6  Good night, sir. My Octavia,
        7  Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
        8  I have not kept my square; but that to come
        9  Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
       10  Good night, sir.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       11  Good night.
  Direction: Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA
  Direction: Enter Soothsayer
    MARK ANTONY
       12  Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?
    Soothsayer
       13  Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
    MARK ANTONY
       14  If you can, your reason?
    Soothsayer
       15  I see it in
       16  My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
       17  Hie you to Egypt again.
    MARK ANTONY
       18  Say to me,
       19  Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
    Soothsayer
       20  Caesar's.
       21  Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
       22  Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
       23  Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
       24  Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
       25  Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
       26  Make space enough between you.
    MARK ANTONY
       27  Speak this no more.
    Soothsayer
       28  To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
       29  If thou dost play with him at any game,
       30  Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,
       31  He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
       32  When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
       33  Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
       34  But, he away, 'tis noble.
    MARK ANTONY
       35  Get thee gone:
       36  Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
  Direction: Exit Soothsayer
       37  He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
       38  He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
       39  And in our sports my better cunning faints
       40  Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
       41  His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
       42  When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
       43  Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
       44  And though I make this marriage for my peace,
       45  I' the east my pleasure lies.
  Direction: Enter VENTIDIUS
       46  O, come, Ventidius,
       47  You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
       48  Follow me, and receive't.
  Direction: Exeunt
