          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 3

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  Where is the fellow?
    ALEXAS
        2  Half afeard to come.
    CLEOPATRA
        3  Go to, go to.
  Direction: Enter the Messenger as before
        4  Come hither, sir.
    ALEXAS
        5  Good majesty,
        6  Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
        7  But when you are well pleased.
    CLEOPATRA
        8  That Herod's head
        9  I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
       10  Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
    Messenger
       11  Most gracious majesty,--
    CLEOPATRA
       12  Didst thou behold Octavia?
    Messenger
       13  Ay, dread queen.
    CLEOPATRA
       14  Where?
    Messenger
       15  Madam, in Rome;
       16  I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
       17  Between her brother and Mark Antony.
    CLEOPATRA
       18  Is she as tall as me?
    Messenger
       19  She is not, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
       20  Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
    Messenger
       21  Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.
    CLEOPATRA
       22  That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
    CHARMIAN
       23  Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
    CLEOPATRA
       24  I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
       25  What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
       26  If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
    Messenger
       27  She creeps:
       28  Her motion and her station are as one;
       29  She shows a body rather than a life,
       30  A statue than a breather.
    CLEOPATRA
       31  Is this certain?
    Messenger
       32  Or I have no observance.
    CHARMIAN
       33  Three in Egypt
       34  Cannot make better note.
    CLEOPATRA
       35  He's very knowing;
       36  I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
       37  The fellow has good judgment.
    CHARMIAN
       38  Excellent.
    CLEOPATRA
       39  Guess at her years, I prithee.
    Messenger
       40  Madam,
       41  She was a widow,--
    CLEOPATRA
       42  Widow! Charmian, hark.
    Messenger
       43  And I do think she's thirty.
    CLEOPATRA
       44  Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
    Messenger
       45  Round even to faultiness.
    CLEOPATRA
       46  For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
       47  Her hair, what colour?
    Messenger
       48  Brown, madam: and her forehead
       49  As low as she would wish it.
    CLEOPATRA
       50  There's gold for thee.
       51  Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
       52  I will employ thee back again; I find thee
       53  Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
       54  Our letters are prepared.
  Direction: Exit Messenger
    CHARMIAN
       55  A proper man.
    CLEOPATRA
       56  Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
       57  That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
       58  This creature's no such thing.
    CHARMIAN
       59  Nothing, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
       60  The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
    CHARMIAN
       61  Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
       62  And serving you so long!
    CLEOPATRA
       63  I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
       64  But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
       65  Where I will write. All may be well enough.
    CHARMIAN
       66  I warrant you, madam.
  Direction: Exeunt
