          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 12

SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  Let him appear that's come from Antony.
        2  Know you him?
    DOLABELLA
        3  Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
        4  An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
        5  He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
        6  Which had superfluous kings for messengers
        7  Not many moons gone by.
  Direction: Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        8  Approach, and speak.
    EUPHRONIUS
        9  Such as I am, I come from Antony:
       10  I was of late as petty to his ends
       11  As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
       12  To his grand sea.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       13  Be't so: declare thine office.
    EUPHRONIUS
       14  Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
       15  Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
       16  He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
       17  To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
       18  A private man in Athens: this for him.
       19  Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
       20  Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
       21  The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
       22  Now hazarded to thy grace.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       23  For Antony,
       24  I have no ears to his request. The queen
       25  Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
       26  From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
       27  Or take his life there: this if she perform,
       28  She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
    EUPHRONIUS
       29  Fortune pursue thee!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       30  Bring him through the bands.
  Direction: Exit EUPHRONIUS
  Direction: To THYREUS
       31  From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
       32  And in our name, what she requires; add more,
       33  From thine invention, offers: women are not
       34  In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
       35  The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
       36  Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
       37  Will answer as a law.
    THYREUS
       38  Caesar, I go.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       39  Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
       40  And what thou think'st his very action speaks
       41  In every power that moves.
    THYREUS
       42  Caesar, I shall.
  Direction: Exeunt
