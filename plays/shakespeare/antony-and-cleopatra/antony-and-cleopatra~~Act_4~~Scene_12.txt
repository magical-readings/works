          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 12

SCENE XII. Another part of the same.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS
    MARK ANTONY
        1  Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
        2  does stand,
        3  I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
        4  Straight, how 'tis like to go.
  Direction: Exit
    SCARUS
        5  Swallows have built
        6  In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
        7  Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
        8  And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
        9  Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
       10  His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
       11  Of what he has, and has not.
  Direction: Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight
  Direction: Re-enter MARK ANTONY
    MARK ANTONY
       12  All is lost;
       13  This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
       14  My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
       15  They cast their caps up and carouse together
       16  Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
       17  'tis thou
       18  Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
       19  Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
       20  For when I am revenged upon my charm,
       21  I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.
  Direction: Exit SCARUS
       22  O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
       23  Fortune and Antony part here; even here
       24  Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
       25  That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
       26  Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
       27  On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
       28  That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
       29  O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
       30  Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
       31  Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
       32  Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
       33  Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
       34  What, Eros, Eros!
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA
       35  Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
    CLEOPATRA
       36  Why is my lord enraged against his love?
    MARK ANTONY
       37  Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
       38  And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
       39  And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
       40  Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
       41  Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
       42  For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
       43  Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
       44  With her prepared nails.
  Direction: Exit CLEOPATRA
       45  'Tis well thou'rt gone,
       46  If it be well to live; but better 'twere
       47  Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
       48  Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
       49  The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
       50  Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
       51  Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
       52  And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
       53  Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
       54  To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
       55  Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!
  Direction: Exit
