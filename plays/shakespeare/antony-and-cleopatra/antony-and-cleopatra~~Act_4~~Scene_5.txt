          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.
  Direction: Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them
    Soldier
        1  The gods make this a happy day to Antony!
    MARK ANTONY
        2  Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
        3  To make me fight at land!
    Soldier
        4  Hadst thou done so,
        5  The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
        6  That has this morning left thee, would have still
        7  Follow'd thy heels.
    MARK ANTONY
        8  Who's gone this morning?
    Soldier
        9  Who!
       10  One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
       11  He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
       12  Say 'I am none of thine.'
    MARK ANTONY
       13  What say'st thou?
    Soldier
       14  Sir,
       15  He is with Caesar.
    EROS
       16  Sir, his chests and treasure
       17  He has not with him.
    MARK ANTONY
       18  Is he gone?
    Soldier
       19  Most certain.
    MARK ANTONY
       20  Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
       21  Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
       22  I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
       23  Say that I wish he never find more cause
       24  To change a master. O, my fortunes have
       25  Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
  Direction: Exeunt
