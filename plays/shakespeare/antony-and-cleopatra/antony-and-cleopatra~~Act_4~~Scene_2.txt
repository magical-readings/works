          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others
    MARK ANTONY
        1  He will not fight with me, Domitius.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        2  No.
    MARK ANTONY
        3  Why should he not?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        4  He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
        5  He is twenty men to one.
    MARK ANTONY
        6  To-morrow, soldier,
        7  By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
        8  Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
        9  Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       10  I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
    MARK ANTONY
       11  Well said; come on.
       12  Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
       13  Be bounteous at our meal.
  Direction: Enter three or four Servitors
       14  Give me thy hand,
       15  Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
       16  Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
       17  And kings have been your fellows.
    CLEOPATRA
       18  [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       19  [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
       20  tricks which sorrow shoots
       21  Out of the mind.
    MARK ANTONY
       22  And thou art honest too.
       23  I wish I could be made so many men,
       24  And all of you clapp'd up together in
       25  An Antony, that I might do you service
       26  So good as you have done.
    All
       27  The gods forbid!
    MARK ANTONY
       28  Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
       29  Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
       30  As when mine empire was your fellow too,
       31  And suffer'd my command.
    CLEOPATRA
       32  [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       33  [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.
    MARK ANTONY
       34  Tend me to-night;
       35  May be it is the period of your duty:
       36  Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
       37  A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
       38  You'll serve another master. I look on you
       39  As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
       40  I turn you not away; but, like a master
       41  Married to your good service, stay till death:
       42  Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
       43  And the gods yield you for't!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       44  What mean you, sir,
       45  To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
       46  And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
       47  Transform us not to women.
    MARK ANTONY
       48  Ho, ho, ho!
       49  Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
       50  Grace grow where those drops fall!
       51  My hearty friends,
       52  You take me in too dolorous a sense;
       53  For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
       54  To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
       55  I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
       56  Where rather I'll expect victorious life
       57  Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
       58  And drown consideration.
  Direction: Exeunt
