          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 1 : Scene 3

SCENE III. The same. Another room.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  Where is he?
    CHARMIAN
        2  I did not see him since.
    CLEOPATRA
        3  See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
        4  I did not send you: if you find him sad,
        5  Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
        6  That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
  Direction: Exit ALEXAS
    CHARMIAN
        7  Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
        8  You do not hold the method to enforce
        9  The like from him.
    CLEOPATRA
       10  What should I do, I do not?
    CHARMIAN
       11  In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.
    CLEOPATRA
       12  Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
    CHARMIAN
       13  Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
       14  In time we hate that which we often fear.
       15  But here comes Antony.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY
    CLEOPATRA
       16  I am sick and sullen.
    MARK ANTONY
       17  I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--
    CLEOPATRA
       18  Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
       19  It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
       20  Will not sustain it.
    MARK ANTONY
       21  Now, my dearest queen,--
    CLEOPATRA
       22  Pray you, stand further from me.
    MARK ANTONY
       23  What's the matter?
    CLEOPATRA
       24  I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
       25  What says the married woman? You may go:
       26  Would she had never given you leave to come!
       27  Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
       28  I have no power upon you; hers you are.
    MARK ANTONY
       29  The gods best know,--
    CLEOPATRA
       30  O, never was there queen
       31  So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
       32  I saw the treasons planted.
    MARK ANTONY
       33  Cleopatra,--
    CLEOPATRA
       34  Why should I think you can be mine and true,
       35  Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
       36  Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
       37  To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
       38  Which break themselves in swearing!
    MARK ANTONY
       39  Most sweet queen,--
    CLEOPATRA
       40  Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
       41  But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
       42  Then was the time for words: no going then;
       43  Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
       44  Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
       45  But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
       46  Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
       47  Art turn'd the greatest liar.
    MARK ANTONY
       48  How now, lady!
    CLEOPATRA
       49  I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
       50  There were a heart in Egypt.
    MARK ANTONY
       51  Hear me, queen:
       52  The strong necessity of time commands
       53  Our services awhile; but my full heart
       54  Remains in use with you. Our Italy
       55  Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
       56  Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
       57  Equality of two domestic powers
       58  Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
       59  Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
       60  Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
       61  Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
       62  Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
       63  And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
       64  By any desperate change: my more particular,
       65  And that which most with you should safe my going,
       66  Is Fulvia's death.
    CLEOPATRA
       67  Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
       68  It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
    MARK ANTONY
       69  She's dead, my queen:
       70  Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
       71  The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
       72  See when and where she died.
    CLEOPATRA
       73  O most false love!
       74  Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
       75  With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
       76  In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
    MARK ANTONY
       77  Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
       78  The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
       79  As you shall give the advice. By the fire
       80  That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
       81  Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
       82  As thou affect'st.
    CLEOPATRA
       83  Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
       84  But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
       85  So Antony loves.
    MARK ANTONY
       86  My precious queen, forbear;
       87  And give true evidence to his love, which stands
       88  An honourable trial.
    CLEOPATRA
       89  So Fulvia told me.
       90  I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
       91  Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
       92  Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
       93  Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
       94  Life perfect honour.
    MARK ANTONY
       95  You'll heat my blood: no more.
    CLEOPATRA
       96  You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
    MARK ANTONY
       97  Now, by my sword,--
    CLEOPATRA
       98  And target. Still he mends;
       99  But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
      100  How this Herculean Roman does become
      101  The carriage of his chafe.
    MARK ANTONY
      102  I'll leave you, lady.
    CLEOPATRA
      103  Courteous lord, one word.
      104  Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
      105  Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
      106  That you know well: something it is I would,
      107  O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
      108  And I am all forgotten.
    MARK ANTONY
      109  But that your royalty
      110  Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
      111  For idleness itself.
    CLEOPATRA
      112  'Tis sweating labour
      113  To bear such idleness so near the heart
      114  As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
      115  Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
      116  Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
      117  Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
      118  And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
      119  Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
      120  Be strew'd before your feet!
    MARK ANTONY
      121  Let us go. Come;
      122  Our separation so abides, and flies,
      123  That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
      124  And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!
  Direction: Exeunt
