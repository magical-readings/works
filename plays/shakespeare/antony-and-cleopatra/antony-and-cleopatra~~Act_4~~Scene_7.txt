          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.
  Direction: Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others
    AGRIPPA
        1  Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
        2  Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
        3  Exceeds what we expected.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded
    SCARUS
        4  O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
        5  Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
        6  With clouts about their heads.
    MARK ANTONY
        7  Thou bleed'st apace.
    SCARUS
        8  I had a wound here that was like a T,
        9  But now 'tis made an H.
    MARK ANTONY
       10  They do retire.
    SCARUS
       11  We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
       12  Room for six scotches more.
  Direction: Enter EROS
    EROS
       13  They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
       14  For a fair victory.
    SCARUS
       15  Let us score their backs,
       16  And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
       17  'Tis sport to maul a runner.
    MARK ANTONY
       18  I will reward thee
       19  Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
       20  For thy good valour. Come thee on.
    SCARUS
       21  I'll halt after.
  Direction: Exeunt
