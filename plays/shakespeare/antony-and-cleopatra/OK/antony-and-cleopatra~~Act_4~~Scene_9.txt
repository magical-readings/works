          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 9

SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
  Direction: Sentinels at their post
    First Soldier
        1  If we be not relieved within this hour,
        2  We must return to the court of guard: the night
        3  Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
        4  By the second hour i' the morn.
    Second Soldier
        5  This last day was
        6  A shrewd one to's.
  Direction: Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        7  O, bear me witness, night,--
    Third Soldier
        8  What man is this?
    Second Soldier
        9  Stand close, and list him.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       10  Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
       11  When men revolted shall upon record
       12  Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
       13  Before thy face repent!
    First Soldier
       14  Enobarbus!
    Third Soldier
       15  Peace!
       16  Hark further.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       17  O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
       18  The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
       19  That life, a very rebel to my will,
       20  May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
       21  Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
       22  Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
       23  And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
       24  Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
       25  Forgive me in thine own particular;
       26  But let the world rank me in register
       27  A master-leaver and a fugitive:
       28  O Antony! O Antony!
  Direction: Dies
    Second Soldier
       29  Let's speak To him.
    First Soldier
       30  Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
       31  May concern Caesar.
    Third Soldier
       32  Let's do so. But he sleeps.
    First Soldier
       33  Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
       34  Was never yet for sleep.
    Second Soldier
       35  Go we to him.
    Third Soldier
       36  Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
    Second Soldier
       37  Hear you, sir?
    First Soldier
       38  The hand of death hath raught him.
  Direction: Drums afar off
       39  Hark! the drums
       40  Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
       41  To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
       42  Is fully out.
    Third Soldier
       43  Come on, then;
       44  He may recover yet.
  Direction: Exeunt with the body
