          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 1 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
        2  It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
        3  Our great competitor: from Alexandria
        4  This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
        5  The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
        6  Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
        7  More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
        8  Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
        9  A man who is the abstract of all faults
       10  That all men follow.
    LEPIDUS
       11  I must not think there are
       12  Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
       13  His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
       14  More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
       15  Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
       16  Than what he chooses.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       17  You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
       18  Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
       19  To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
       20  And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
       21  To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
       22  With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
       23  becomes him,--
       24  As his composure must be rare indeed
       25  Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
       26  No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
       27  So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
       28  His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
       29  Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
       30  Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
       31  That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
       32  As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
       33  As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
       34  Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
       35  And so rebel to judgment.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    LEPIDUS
       36  Here's more news.
    Messenger
       37  Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
       38  Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
       39  How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
       40  And it appears he is beloved of those
       41  That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
       42  The discontents repair, and men's reports
       43  Give him much wrong'd.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       44  I should have known no less.
       45  It hath been taught us from the primal state,
       46  That he which is was wish'd until he were;
       47  And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
       48  Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
       49  Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
       50  Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
       51  To rot itself with motion.
    Messenger
       52  Caesar, I bring thee word,
       53  Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
       54  Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
       55  With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
       56  They make in Italy; the borders maritime
       57  Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
       58  No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
       59  Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
       60  Than could his war resisted.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       61  Antony,
       62  Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
       63  Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
       64  Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
       65  Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
       66  Though daintily brought up, with patience more
       67  Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
       68  The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
       69  Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
       70  The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
       71  Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
       72  The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
       73  It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
       74  Which some did die to look on: and all this--
       75  It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
       76  Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
       77  So much as lank'd not.
    LEPIDUS
       78  'Tis pity of him.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       79  Let his shames quickly
       80  Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
       81  Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
       82  Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
       83  Thrives in our idleness.
    LEPIDUS
       84  To-morrow, Caesar,
       85  I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
       86  Both what by sea and land I can be able
       87  To front this present time.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       88  Till which encounter,
       89  It is my business too. Farewell.
    LEPIDUS
       90  Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
       91  Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
       92  To let me be partaker.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       93  Doubt not, sir;
       94  I knew it for my bond.
  Direction: Exeunt
