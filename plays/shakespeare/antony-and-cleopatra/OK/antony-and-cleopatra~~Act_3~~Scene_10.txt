          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 10

SCENE X. Another part of the plain.
  Direction: CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight
  Direction: Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        1  Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
        2  The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
        3  With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
        4  To see't mine eyes are blasted.
  Direction: Enter SCARUS
    SCARUS
        5  Gods and goddesses,
        6  All the whole synod of them!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        7  What's thy passion!
    SCARUS
        8  The greater cantle of the world is lost
        9  With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
       10  Kingdoms and provinces.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       11  How appears the fight?
    SCARUS
       12  On our side like the token'd pestilence,
       13  Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
       14  Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
       15  When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
       16  Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
       17  The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
       18  Hoists sails and flies.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       19  That I beheld:
       20  Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
       21  Endure a further view.
    SCARUS
       22  She once being loof'd,
       23  The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
       24  Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
       25  Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
       26  I never saw an action of such shame;
       27  Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
       28  Did violate so itself.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       29  Alack, alack!
  Direction: Enter CANIDIUS
    CANIDIUS
       30  Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
       31  And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
       32  Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
       33  O, he has given example for our flight,
       34  Most grossly, by his own!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       35  Ay, are you thereabouts?
       36  Why, then, good night indeed.
    CANIDIUS
       37  Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
    SCARUS
       38  'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
       39  What further comes.
    CANIDIUS
       40  To Caesar will I render
       41  My legions and my horse: six kings already
       42  Show me the way of yielding.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       43  I'll yet follow
       44  The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
       45  Sits in the wind against me.
  Direction: Exeunt
