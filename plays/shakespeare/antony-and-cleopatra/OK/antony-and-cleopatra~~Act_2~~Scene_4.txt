          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The same. A street.
  Direction: Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
    LEPIDUS
        1  Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
        2  Your generals after.
    AGRIPPA
        3  Sir, Mark Antony
        4  Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
    LEPIDUS
        5  Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
        6  Which will become you both, farewell.
    MECAENAS
        7  We shall,
        8  As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
        9  Before you, Lepidus.
    LEPIDUS
       10  Your way is shorter;
       11  My purposes do draw me much about:
       12  You'll win two days upon me.
    MECAENAS and AGRIPPA
       13  Sir, good success!
    LEPIDUS
       14  Farewell.
  Direction: Exeunt
