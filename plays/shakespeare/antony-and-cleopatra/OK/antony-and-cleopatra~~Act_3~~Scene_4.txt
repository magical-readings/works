          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA
    MARK ANTONY
        1  Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
        2  That were excusable, that, and thousands more
        3  Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
        4  New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
        5  To public ear:
        6  Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
        7  But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
        8  He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
        9  When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
       10  Or did it from his teeth.
    OCTAVIA
       11  O my good lord,
       12  Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
       13  Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
       14  If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
       15  Praying for both parts:
       16  The good gods me presently,
       17  When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
       18  Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
       19  'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
       20  Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
       21  'Twixt these extremes at all.
    MARK ANTONY
       22  Gentle Octavia,
       23  Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
       24  Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
       25  I lose myself: better I were not yours
       26  Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
       27  Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
       28  I'll raise the preparation of a war
       29  Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
       30  So your desires are yours.
    OCTAVIA
       31  Thanks to my lord.
       32  The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
       33  Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
       34  As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
       35  Should solder up the rift.
    MARK ANTONY
       36  When it appears to you where this begins,
       37  Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
       38  Can never be so equal, that your love
       39  Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
       40  Choose your own company, and command what cost
       41  Your heart has mind to.
  Direction: Exeunt
