          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 5 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  My desolation does begin to make
        2  A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
        3  Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
        4  A minister of her will: and it is great
        5  To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
        6  Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
        7  Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
        8  The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
  Direction: Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers
    PROCULEIUS
        9  Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
       10  And bids thee study on what fair demands
       11  Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
    CLEOPATRA
       12  What's thy name?
    PROCULEIUS
       13  My name is Proculeius.
    CLEOPATRA
       14  Antony
       15  Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
       16  I do not greatly care to be deceived,
       17  That have no use for trusting. If your master
       18  Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
       19  That majesty, to keep decorum, must
       20  No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
       21  To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
       22  He gives me so much of mine own, as I
       23  Will kneel to him with thanks.
    PROCULEIUS
       24  Be of good cheer;
       25  You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:
       26  Make your full reference freely to my lord,
       27  Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
       28  On all that need: let me report to him
       29  Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
       30  A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
       31  Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
    CLEOPATRA
       32  Pray you, tell him
       33  I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
       34  The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
       35  A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
       36  Look him i' the face.
    PROCULEIUS
       37  This I'll report, dear lady.
       38  Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
       39  Of him that caused it.
    GALLUS
       40  You see how easily she may be surprised:
  Direction: Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the monument by a ladder placed against a window, and, having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates
  Direction: To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
       41  Guard her till Caesar come.
  Direction: Exit
    IRAS
       42  Royal queen!
    CHARMIAN
       43  O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
    CLEOPATRA
       44  Quick, quick, good hands.
  Direction: Drawing a dagger
    PROCULEIUS
       45  Hold, worthy lady, hold:
  Direction: Seizes and disarms her
       46  Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
       47  Relieved, but not betray'd.
    CLEOPATRA
       48  What, of death too,
       49  That rids our dogs of languish?
    PROCULEIUS
       50  Cleopatra,
       51  Do not abuse my master's bounty by
       52  The undoing of yourself: let the world see
       53  His nobleness well acted, which your death
       54  Will never let come forth.
    CLEOPATRA
       55  Where art thou, death?
       56  Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
       57  Worthy many babes and beggars!
    PROCULEIUS
       58  O, temperance, lady!
    CLEOPATRA
       59  Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
       60  If idle talk will once be necessary,
       61  I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
       62  Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
       63  Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
       64  Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
       65  Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
       66  And show me to the shouting varletry
       67  Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
       68  Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
       69  Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
       70  Blow me into abhorring! rather make
       71  My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
       72  And hang me up in chains!
    PROCULEIUS
       73  You do extend
       74  These thoughts of horror further than you shall
       75  Find cause in Caesar.
  Direction: Enter DOLABELLA
    DOLABELLA
       76  Proculeius,
       77  What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
       78  And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
       79  I'll take her to my guard.
    PROCULEIUS
       80  So, Dolabella,
       81  It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
  Direction: To CLEOPATRA
       82  To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
       83  If you'll employ me to him.
    CLEOPATRA
       84  Say, I would die.
  Direction: Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers
    DOLABELLA
       85  Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
    CLEOPATRA
       86  I cannot tell.
    DOLABELLA
       87  Assuredly you know me.
    CLEOPATRA
       88  No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
       89  You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
       90  Is't not your trick?
    DOLABELLA
       91  I understand not, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
       92  I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
       93  O, such another sleep, that I might see
       94  But such another man!
    DOLABELLA
       95  If it might please ye,--
    CLEOPATRA
       96  His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
       97  A sun and moon, which kept their course,
       98  and lighted
       99  The little O, the earth.
    DOLABELLA
      100  Most sovereign creature,--
    CLEOPATRA
      101  His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
      102  Crested the world: his voice was propertied
      103  As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
      104  But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
      105  He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
      106  There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
      107  That grew the more by reaping: his delights
      108  Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
      109  The element they lived in: in his livery
      110  Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
      111  As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
    DOLABELLA
      112  Cleopatra!
    CLEOPATRA
      113  Think you there was, or might be, such a man
      114  As this I dream'd of?
    DOLABELLA
      115  Gentle madam, no.
    CLEOPATRA
      116  You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
      117  But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
      118  It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
      119  To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
      120  And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
      121  Condemning shadows quite.
    DOLABELLA
      122  Hear me, good madam.
      123  Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
      124  As answering to the weight: would I might never
      125  O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
      126  By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
      127  My very heart at root.
    CLEOPATRA
      128  I thank you, sir,
      129  Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
    DOLABELLA
      130  I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
    CLEOPATRA
      131  Nay, pray you, sir,--
    DOLABELLA
      132  Though he be honourable,--
    CLEOPATRA
      133  He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
    DOLABELLA
      134  Madam, he will; I know't.
  Direction: Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      135  Which is the Queen of Egypt?
    DOLABELLA
      136  It is the emperor, madam.
  Direction: CLEOPATRA kneels
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      137  Arise, you shall not kneel:
      138  I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
    CLEOPATRA
      139  Sir, the gods
      140  Will have it thus; my master and my lord
      141  I must obey.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      142  Take to you no hard thoughts:
      143  The record of what injuries you did us,
      144  Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
      145  As things but done by chance.
    CLEOPATRA
      146  Sole sir o' the world,
      147  I cannot project mine own cause so well
      148  To make it clear; but do confess I have
      149  Been laden with like frailties which before
      150  Have often shamed our sex.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      151  Cleopatra, know,
      152  We will extenuate rather than enforce:
      153  If you apply yourself to our intents,
      154  Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
      155  A benefit in this change; but if you seek
      156  To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
      157  Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
      158  Of my good purposes, and put your children
      159  To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
      160  If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
    CLEOPATRA
      161  And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
      162  Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
      163  Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      164  You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
    CLEOPATRA
      165  This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
      166  I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
      167  Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
    SELEUCUS
      168  Here, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
      169  This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
      170  Upon his peril, that I have reserved
      171  To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
    SELEUCUS
      172  Madam,
      173  I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
      174  Speak that which is not.
    CLEOPATRA
      175  What have I kept back?
    SELEUCUS
      176  Enough to purchase what you have made known.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      177  Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
      178  Your wisdom in the deed.
    CLEOPATRA
      179  See, Caesar! O, behold,
      180  How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
      181  And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
      182  The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
      183  Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
      184  Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
      185  Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
      186  Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
      187  O rarely base!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      188  Good queen, let us entreat you.
    CLEOPATRA
      189  O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
      190  That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
      191  Doing the honour of thy lordliness
      192  To one so meek, that mine own servant should
      193  Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
      194  Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
      195  That I some lady trifles have reserved,
      196  Immoment toys, things of such dignity
      197  As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
      198  Some nobler token I have kept apart
      199  For Livia and Octavia, to induce
      200  Their mediation; must I be unfolded
      201  With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
      202  Beneath the fall I have.
  Direction: To SELEUCUS
      203  Prithee, go hence;
      204  Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
      205  Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
      206  Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      207  Forbear, Seleucus.
  Direction: Exit SELEUCUS
    CLEOPATRA
      208  Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
      209  For things that others do; and, when we fall,
      210  We answer others' merits in our name,
      211  Are therefore to be pitied.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      212  Cleopatra,
      213  Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
      214  Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
      215  Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
      216  Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
      217  Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
      218  Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
      219  For we intend so to dispose you as
      220  Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
      221  Our care and pity is so much upon you,
      222  That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
    CLEOPATRA
      223  My master, and my lord!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      224  Not so. Adieu.
  Direction: Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train
    CLEOPATRA
      225  He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
      226  Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
  Direction: Whispers CHARMIAN
    IRAS
      227  Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
      228  And we are for the dark.
    CLEOPATRA
      229  Hie thee again:
      230  I have spoke already, and it is provided;
      231  Go put it to the haste.
    CHARMIAN
      232  Madam, I will.
  Direction: Re-enter DOLABELLA
    DOLABELLA
      233  Where is the queen?
    CHARMIAN
      234  Behold, sir.
  Direction: Exit
    CLEOPATRA
      235  Dolabella!
    DOLABELLA
      236  Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
      237  Which my love makes religion to obey,
      238  I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
      239  Intends his journey; and within three days
      240  You with your children will he send before:
      241  Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
      242  Your pleasure and my promise.
    CLEOPATRA
      243  Dolabella,
      244  I shall remain your debtor.
    DOLABELLA
      245  I your servant,
      246  Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.
    CLEOPATRA
      247  Farewell, and thanks.
  Direction: Exit DOLABELLA
      248  Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
      249  Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
      250  In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves
      251  With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
      252  Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
      253  Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
      254  And forced to drink their vapour.
    IRAS
      255  The gods forbid!
    CLEOPATRA
      256  Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
      257  Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
      258  Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
      259  Extemporally will stage us, and present
      260  Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
      261  Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
      262  Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
      263  I' the posture of a whore.
    IRAS
      264  O the good gods!
    CLEOPATRA
      265  Nay, that's certain.
    IRAS
      266  I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
      267  Are stronger than mine eyes.
    CLEOPATRA
      268  Why, that's the way
      269  To fool their preparation, and to conquer
      270  Their most absurd intents.
  Direction: Re-enter CHARMIAN
      271  Now, Charmian!
      272  Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
      273  My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
      274  To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
      275  Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
      276  And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
      277  To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
      278  Wherefore's this noise?
  Direction: Exit IRAS. A noise within
  Direction: Enter a Guardsman
    Guard
      279  Here is a rural fellow
      280  That will not be denied your highness presence:
      281  He brings you figs.
    CLEOPATRA
      282  Let him come in.
  Direction: Exit Guardsman
      283  What poor an instrument
      284  May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
      285  My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
      286  Of woman in me: now from head to foot
      287  I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
      288  No planet is of mine.
  Direction: Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket
    Guard
      289  This is the man.
    CLEOPATRA
      290  Avoid, and leave him.
  Direction: Exit Guardsman
      291  Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
      292  That kills and pains not?
    Clown
      293  Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
      294  that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
      295  is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
      296  never recover.
    CLEOPATRA
      297  Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
    Clown
      298  Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
      299  them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
      300  but something given to lie; as a woman should not
      301  do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
      302  biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
      303  a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
      304  believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
      305  half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
      306  worm's an odd worm.
    CLEOPATRA
      307  Get thee hence; farewell.
    Clown
      308  I wish you all joy of the worm.
  Direction: Setting down his basket
    CLEOPATRA
      309  Farewell.
    Clown
      310  You must think this, look you, that the worm will
      311  do his kind.
    CLEOPATRA
      312  Ay, ay; farewell.
    Clown
      313  Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
      314  keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
      315  goodness in worm.
    CLEOPATRA
      316  Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
    Clown
      317  Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
      318  not worth the feeding.
    CLEOPATRA
      319  Will it eat me?
    Clown
      320  You must not think I am so simple but I know the
      321  devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
      322  woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
      323  not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
      324  gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
      325  that they make, the devils mar five.
    CLEOPATRA
      326  Well, get thee gone; farewell.
    Clown
      327  Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, and c
    CLEOPATRA
      328  Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
      329  Immortal longings in me: now no more
      330  The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
      331  Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
      332  Antony call; I see him rouse himself
      333  To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
      334  The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
      335  To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
      336  Now to that name my courage prove my title!
      337  I am fire and air; my other elements
      338  I give to baser life. So; have you done?
      339  Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
      340  Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
  Direction: Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
      341  Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
      342  If thou and nature can so gently part,
      343  The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
      344  Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
      345  If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
      346  It is not worth leave-taking.
    CHARMIAN
      347  Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
      348  The gods themselves do weep!
    CLEOPATRA
      349  This proves me base:
      350  If she first meet the curled Antony,
      351  He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
      352  Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
      353  mortal wretch,
  Direction: To an asp, which she applies to her breast
      354  With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
      355  Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
      356  Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
      357  That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
      358  Unpolicied!
    CHARMIAN
      359  O eastern star!
    CLEOPATRA
      360  Peace, peace!
      361  Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
      362  That sucks the nurse asleep?
    CHARMIAN
      363  O, break! O, break!
    CLEOPATRA
      364  As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
      365  O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
  Direction: Applying another asp to her arm
      366  What should I stay--
  Direction: Dies
    CHARMIAN
      367  In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
      368  Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
      369  A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
      370  And golden Phoebus never be beheld
      371  Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
      372  I'll mend it, and then play.
  Direction: Enter the Guard, rushing in
    First Guard
      373  Where is the queen?
    CHARMIAN
      374  Speak softly, wake her not.
    First Guard
      375  Caesar hath sent--
    CHARMIAN
      376  Too slow a messenger.
  Direction: Applies an asp
      377  O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
    First Guard
      378  Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
    Second Guard
      379  There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
    First Guard
      380  What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
    CHARMIAN
      381  It is well done, and fitting for a princess
      382  Descended of so many royal kings.
      383  Ah, soldier!
  Direction: Dies
  Direction: Re-enter DOLABELLA
    DOLABELLA
      384  How goes it here?
    Second Guard
      385  All dead.
    DOLABELLA
      386  Caesar, thy thoughts
      387  Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
      388  To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
      389  So sought'st to hinder.
  Direction: Within 'A way there, a way for Caesar!'
  Direction: Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching
    DOLABELLA
      390  O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
      391  That you did fear is done.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      392  Bravest at the last,
      393  She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
      394  Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
      395  I do not see them bleed.
    DOLABELLA
      396  Who was last with them?
    First Guard
      397  A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
      398  This was his basket.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      399  Poison'd, then.
    First Guard
      400  O Caesar,
      401  This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
      402  I found her trimming up the diadem
      403  On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
      404  And on the sudden dropp'd.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      405  O noble weakness!
      406  If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
      407  By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
      408  As she would catch another Antony
      409  In her strong toil of grace.
    DOLABELLA
      410  Here, on her breast,
      411  There is a vent of blood and something blown:
      412  The like is on her arm.
    First Guard
      413  This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
      414  Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
      415  Upon the caves of Nile.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      416  Most probable
      417  That so she died; for her physician tells me
      418  She hath pursued conclusions infinite
      419  Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
      420  And bear her women from the monument:
      421  She shall be buried by her Antony:
      422  No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
      423  A pair so famous. High events as these
      424  Strike those that make them; and their story is
      425  No less in pity than his glory which
      426  Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
      427  In solemn show attend this funeral;
      428  And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
      429  High order in this great solemnity.
  Direction: Exeunt
