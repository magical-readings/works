        2  It will determine one way: fare you well.
        3  Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
    First Soldier
        4  Nothing. What news?

       11  Our landmen will stand up.
    Third Soldier
       12  'Tis a brave army,
       13  And full of purpose.

    Fourth Soldier
       14  Peace! what noise?

       15  List, list!
    Second Soldier
       16  Hark!
    First Soldier
       17  Music i' the air.

       18  Under the earth.
    Fourth Soldier
       19  It signs well, does it not?
    Third Soldier
       20  No.
    First Soldier
       21  Peace, I say!
       22  What should this mean?

       23  'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
       24  Now leaves him.
    First Soldier
       25  Walk; let's see if other watchmen
       26  Do hear what we do?
  Direction: They advance to another post
    Second Soldier
       27  How now, masters!
    All
       28  [Speaking together] How now!
       29  How now! do you hear this?
    First Soldier
       30  Ay; is't not strange?
    Third Soldier
       31  Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
    First Soldier
       32  Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
       33  Let's see how it will give off.
    All
       34  Content. 'Tis strange.
  Direction: Exeunt
