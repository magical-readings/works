          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 14

SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS
    MARK ANTONY
        1  Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
    EROS
        2  Ay, noble lord.
    MARK ANTONY
        3  Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
        4  A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
        5  A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
        6  A forked mountain, or blue promontory
        7  With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
        8  And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
        9  these signs;
       10  They are black vesper's pageants.
    EROS
       11  Ay, my lord,
    MARK ANTONY
       12  That which is now a horse, even with a thought
       13  The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
       14  As water is in water.
    EROS
       15  It does, my lord.
    MARK ANTONY
       16  My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
       17  Even such a body: here I am Antony:
       18  Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
       19  I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
       20  Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
       21  Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
       22  A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
       23  Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
       24  Unto an enemy's triumph.
       25  Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
       26  Ourselves to end ourselves.
  Direction: Enter MARDIAN
       27  O! thy vile lady!
       28  She has robb'd me of my sword.
    MARDIAN
       29  No, Antony;
       30  My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
       31  With thine entirely.
    MARK ANTONY
       32  Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
       33  She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
    MARDIAN
       34  Death of one person can be paid but once,
       35  And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
       36  Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
       37  Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
       38  Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
       39  The name of Antony; it was divided
       40  Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
       41  Thy name so buried in her.
    MARK ANTONY
       42  Dead, then?
    MARDIAN
       43  Dead.
    MARK ANTONY
       44  Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
       45  And we must sleep.
  Direction: To MARDIAN
       46  That thou depart'st hence safe,
       47  Does pay thy labour richly; go.
  Direction: Exit MARDIAN
       48  Off, pluck off:
       49  The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
       50  The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
       51  Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
       52  Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
       53  No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
       54  You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
  Direction: Exit EROS
       55  I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
       56  Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
       57  All length is torture: since the torch is out,
       58  Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
       59  Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
       60  Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
       61  Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:
       62  Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
       63  And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
       64  Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
       65  And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!
  Direction: Re-enter EROS
    EROS
       66  What would my lord?
    MARK ANTONY
       67  Since Cleopatra died,
       68  I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
       69  Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
       70  Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
       71  With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
       72  The courage of a woman; less noble mind
       73  Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
       74  'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
       75  That, when the exigent should come, which now
       76  Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
       77  The inevitable prosecution of
       78  Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
       79  Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
       80  Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
       81  Put colour in thy cheek.
    EROS
       82  The gods withhold me!
       83  Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
       84  Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?
    MARK ANTONY
       85  Eros,
       86  Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
       87  Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
       88  His corrigible neck, his face subdued
       89  To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
       90  Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
       91  His baseness that ensued?
    EROS
       92  I would not see't.
    MARK ANTONY
       93  Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
       94  Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
       95  Most useful for thy country.
    EROS
       96  O, sir, pardon me!
    MARK ANTONY
       97  When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
       98  To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
       99  Or thy precedent services are all
      100  But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
    EROS
      101  Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
      102  Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
    MARK ANTONY
      103  Lo thee!
  Direction: Turning from him
    EROS
      104  My sword is drawn.
    MARK ANTONY
      105  Then let it do at once
      106  The thing why thou hast drawn it.
    EROS
      107  My dear master,
      108  My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
      109  Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
    MARK ANTONY
      110  'Tis said, man; and farewell.
    EROS
      111  Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
    MARK ANTONY
      112  Now, Eros.
    EROS
      113  Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
      114  Of Antony's death.
  Direction: Kills himself
    MARK ANTONY
      115  Thrice-nobler than myself!
      116  Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
      117  I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
      118  Have by their brave instruction got upon me
      119  A nobleness in record: but I will be
      120  A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
      121  As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
      122  Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
  Direction: Falling on his sword
      123  I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
      124  The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
  Direction: Enter DERCETAS and Guard
    First Guard
      125  What's the noise?
    MARK ANTONY
      126  I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
      127  Of what I have begun.
    Second Guard
      128  The star is fall'n.
    First Guard
      129  And time is at his period.
    All
      130  Alas, and woe!
    MARK ANTONY
      131  Let him that loves me strike me dead.
    First Guard
      132  Not I.
    Second Guard
      133  Nor I.
    Third Guard
      134  Nor any one.
  Direction: Exeunt Guard
    DERCETAS
      135  Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
      136  This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
      137  Shall enter me with him.
  Direction: Enter DIOMEDES
    DIOMEDES
      138  Where's Antony?
    DERCETAS
      139  There, Diomed there.
    DIOMEDES
      140  Lives he?
      141  Wilt thou not answer, man?
  Direction: Exit DERCETAS
    MARK ANTONY
      142  Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
      143  Sufficing strokes for death.
    DIOMEDES
      144  Most absolute lord,
      145  My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
    MARK ANTONY
      146  When did she send thee?
    DIOMEDES
      147  Now, my lord.
    MARK ANTONY
      148  Where is she?
    DIOMEDES
      149  Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
      150  Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
      151  Which never shall be found--you did suspect
      152  She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
      153  Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
      154  But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
      155  Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
      156  I dread, too late.
    MARK ANTONY
      157  Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.
    DIOMEDES
      158  What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
      159  Come, your lord calls!
  Direction: Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY
    MARK ANTONY
      160  Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
      161  'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
    First Guard
      162  Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
      163  All your true followers out.
    All
      164  Most heavy day!
    MARK ANTONY
      165  Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
      166  To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
      167  Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
      168  Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
      169  I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
      170  And have my thanks for all.
  Direction: Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY
