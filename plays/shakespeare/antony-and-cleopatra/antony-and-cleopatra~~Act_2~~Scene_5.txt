          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  Give me some music; music, moody food
        2  Of us that trade in love.
    Attendants
        3  The music, ho!
  Direction: Enter MARDIAN
    CLEOPATRA
        4  Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.
    CHARMIAN
        5  My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
    CLEOPATRA
        6  As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
        7  As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
    MARDIAN
        8  As well as I can, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
        9  And when good will is show'd, though't come
       10  too short,
       11  The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
       12  Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
       13  My music playing far off, I will betray
       14  Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
       15  Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
       16  I'll think them every one an Antony,
       17  And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'
    CHARMIAN
       18  'Twas merry when
       19  You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
       20  Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
       21  With fervency drew up.
    CLEOPATRA
       22  That time,--O times!--
       23  I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
       24  I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
       25  Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
       26  Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
       27  I wore his sword Philippan.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
       28  O, from Italy
       29  Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
       30  That long time have been barren.
    Messenger
       31  Madam, madam,--
    CLEOPATRA
       32  Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
       33  Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
       34  If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
       35  My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
       36  Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
    Messenger
       37  First, madam, he is well.
    CLEOPATRA
       38  Why, there's more gold.
       39  But, sirrah, mark, we use
       40  To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
       41  The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
       42  Down thy ill-uttering throat.
    Messenger
       43  Good madam, hear me.
    CLEOPATRA
       44  Well, go to, I will;
       45  But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
       46  Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
       47  To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
       48  Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
       49  Not like a formal man.
    Messenger
       50  Will't please you hear me?
    CLEOPATRA
       51  I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
       52  Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
       53  Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
       54  I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
       55  Rich pearls upon thee.
    Messenger
       56  Madam, he's well.
    CLEOPATRA
       57  Well said.
    Messenger
       58  And friends with Caesar.
    CLEOPATRA
       59  Thou'rt an honest man.
    Messenger
       60  Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
    CLEOPATRA
       61  Make thee a fortune from me.
    Messenger
       62  But yet, madam,--
    CLEOPATRA
       63  I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
       64  The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
       65  'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
       66  Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
       67  Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
       68  The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
       69  In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
    Messenger
       70  Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
       71  He's bound unto Octavia.
    CLEOPATRA
       72  For what good turn?
    Messenger
       73  For the best turn i' the bed.
    CLEOPATRA
       74  I am pale, Charmian.
    Messenger
       75  Madam, he's married to Octavia.
    CLEOPATRA
       76  The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
  Direction: Strikes him down
    Messenger
       77  Good madam, patience.
    CLEOPATRA
       78  What say you? Hence,
  Direction: Strikes him again
       79  Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
       80  Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
  Direction: She hales him up and down
       81  Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
       82  Smarting in lingering pickle.
    Messenger
       83  Gracious madam,
       84  I that do bring the news made not the match.
    CLEOPATRA
       85  Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
       86  And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
       87  Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
       88  And I will boot thee with what gift beside
       89  Thy modesty can beg.
    Messenger
       90  He's married, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
       91  Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
  Direction: Draws a knife
    Messenger
       92  Nay, then I'll run.
       93  What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
  Direction: Exit
    CHARMIAN
       94  Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
       95  The man is innocent.
    CLEOPATRA
       96  Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
       97  Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
       98  Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
       99  Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
    CHARMIAN
      100  He is afeard to come.
    CLEOPATRA
      101  I will not hurt him.
  Direction: Exit CHARMIAN
      102  These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
      103  A meaner than myself; since I myself
      104  Have given myself the cause.
  Direction: Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger
      105  Come hither, sir.
      106  Though it be honest, it is never good
      107  To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
      108  An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
      109  Themselves when they be felt.
    Messenger
      110  I have done my duty.
    CLEOPATRA
      111  Is he married?
      112  I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
      113  If thou again say 'Yes.'
    Messenger
      114  He's married, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
      115  The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
    Messenger
      116  Should I lie, madam?
    CLEOPATRA
      117  O, I would thou didst,
      118  So half my Egypt were submerged and made
      119  A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
      120  Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
      121  Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
    Messenger
      122  I crave your highness' pardon.
    CLEOPATRA
      123  He is married?
    Messenger
      124  Take no offence that I would not offend you:
      125  To punish me for what you make me do.
      126  Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
    CLEOPATRA
      127  O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
      128  That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
      129  The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
      130  Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
      131  And be undone by 'em!
  Direction: Exit Messenger
    CHARMIAN
      132  Good your highness, patience.
    CLEOPATRA
      133  In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
    CHARMIAN
      134  Many times, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
      135  I am paid for't now.
      136  Lead me from hence:
      137  I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
      138  Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
      139  Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
      140  Her inclination, let him not leave out
      141  The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
  Direction: Exit ALEXAS
      142  Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
      143  Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
      144  The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
  Direction: To MARDIAN
      145  Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
      146  But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
  Direction: Exeunt
