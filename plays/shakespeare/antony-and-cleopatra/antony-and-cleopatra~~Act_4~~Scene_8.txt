          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 8

SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.
  Direction: Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS, with others
    MARK ANTONY
        1  We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
        2  And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
        3  Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
        4  That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
        5  For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
        6  Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
        7  Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
        8  Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
        9  Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
       10  Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
       11  The honour'd gashes whole.
  Direction: To SCARUS
       12  Give me thy hand
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
       13  To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
       14  Make her thanks bless thee.
  Direction: To CLEOPATRA
       15  O thou day o' the world,
       16  Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
       17  Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
       18  Ride on the pants triumphing!
    CLEOPATRA
       19  Lord of lords!
       20  O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
       21  The world's great snare uncaught?
    MARK ANTONY
       22  My nightingale,
       23  We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
       24  though grey
       25  Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
       26  A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
       27  Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
       28  Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
       29  Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
       30  As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
       31  Destroy'd in such a shape.
    CLEOPATRA
       32  I'll give thee, friend,
       33  An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
    MARK ANTONY
       34  He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
       35  Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
       36  Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
       37  Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
       38  Had our great palace the capacity
       39  To camp this host, we all would sup together,
       40  And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
       41  Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
       42  With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
       43  Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
       44  That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
       45  Applauding our approach.
  Direction: Exeunt
