          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Near Misenum.
  Direction: Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching
    POMPEY
        1  Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
        2  And we shall talk before we fight.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        3  Most meet
        4  That first we come to words; and therefore have we
        5  Our written purposes before us sent;
        6  Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
        7  If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
        8  And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
        9  That else must perish here.
    POMPEY
       10  To you all three,
       11  The senators alone of this great world,
       12  Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
       13  Wherefore my father should revengers want,
       14  Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
       15  Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
       16  There saw you labouring for him. What was't
       17  That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
       18  Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
       19  With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
       20  To drench the Capitol; but that they would
       21  Have one man but a man? And that is it
       22  Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
       23  The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
       24  To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
       25  Cast on my noble father.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       26  Take your time.
    MARK ANTONY
       27  Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
       28  We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
       29  How much we do o'er-count thee.
    POMPEY
       30  At land, indeed,
       31  Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
       32  But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
       33  Remain in't as thou mayst.
    LEPIDUS
       34  Be pleased to tell us--
       35  For this is from the present--how you take
       36  The offers we have sent you.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       37  There's the point.
    MARK ANTONY
       38  Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
       39  What it is worth embraced.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       40  And what may follow,
       41  To try a larger fortune.
    POMPEY
       42  You have made me offer
       43  Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
       44  Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
       45  Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
       46  To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
       47  Our targes undinted.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY and LEPIDUS
       48  That's our offer.
    POMPEY
       49  Know, then,
       50  I came before you here a man prepared
       51  To take this offer: but Mark Antony
       52  Put me to some impatience: though I lose
       53  The praise of it by telling, you must know,
       54  When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
       55  Your mother came to Sicily and did find
       56  Her welcome friendly.
    MARK ANTONY
       57  I have heard it, Pompey;
       58  And am well studied for a liberal thanks
       59  Which I do owe you.
    POMPEY
       60  Let me have your hand:
       61  I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
    MARK ANTONY
       62  The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
       63  That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
       64  For I have gain'd by 't.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       65  Since I saw you last,
       66  There is a change upon you.
    POMPEY
       67  Well, I know not
       68  What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
       69  But in my bosom shall she never come,
       70  To make my heart her vassal.
    LEPIDUS
       71  Well met here.
    POMPEY
       72  I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
       73  I crave our composition may be written,
       74  And seal'd between us.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       75  That's the next to do.
    POMPEY
       76  We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
       77  Draw lots who shall begin.
    MARK ANTONY
       78  That will I, Pompey.
    POMPEY
       79  No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
       80  Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
       81  Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
       82  Grew fat with feasting there.
    MARK ANTONY
       83  You have heard much.
    POMPEY
       84  I have fair meanings, sir.
    MARK ANTONY
       85  And fair words to them.
    POMPEY
       86  Then so much have I heard:
       87  And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       88  No more of that: he did so.
    POMPEY
       89  What, I pray you?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       90  A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
    POMPEY
       91  I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       92  Well;
       93  And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
       94  Four feasts are toward.
    POMPEY
       95  Let me shake thy hand;
       96  I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
       97  When I have envied thy behavior.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       98  Sir,
       99  I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
      100  When you have well deserved ten times as much
      101  As I have said you did.
    POMPEY
      102  Enjoy thy plainness,
      103  It nothing ill becomes thee.
      104  Aboard my galley I invite you all:
      105  Will you lead, lords?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY and LEPIDUS
      106  Show us the way, sir.
    POMPEY
      107  Come.
  Direction: Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS
    MENAS
      108  [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
      109  made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      110  At sea, I think.
    MENAS
      111  We have, sir.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      112  You have done well by water.
    MENAS
      113  And you by land.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      114  I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
      115  cannot be denied what I have done by land.
    MENAS
      116  Nor what I have done by water.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      117  Yes, something you can deny for your own
      118  safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
    MENAS
      119  And you by land.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      120  There I deny my land service. But give me your
      121  hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
      122  might take two thieves kissing.
    MENAS
      123  All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      124  But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
    MENAS
      125  No slander; they steal hearts.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      126  We came hither to fight with you.
    MENAS
      127  For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
      128  Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      129  If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
    MENAS
      130  You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
      131  here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      132  Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
    MENAS
      133  True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      134  But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
    MENAS
      135  Pray ye, sir?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      136  'Tis true.
    MENAS
      137  Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      138  If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
      139  not prophesy so.
    MENAS
      140  I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
      141  marriage than the love of the parties.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      142  I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
      143  seems to tie their friendship together will be the
      144  very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
      145  holy, cold, and still conversation.
    MENAS
      146  Who would not have his wife so?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      147  Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
      148  He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
      149  sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
      150  I said before, that which is the strength of their
      151  amity shall prove the immediate author of their
      152  variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
      153  he married but his occasion here.
    MENAS
      154  And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
      155  I have a health for you.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      156  I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
    MENAS
      157  Come, let's away.
  Direction: Exeunt
