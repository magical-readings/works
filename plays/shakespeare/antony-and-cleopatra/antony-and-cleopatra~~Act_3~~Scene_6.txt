          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
        2  In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
        3  I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
        4  Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
        5  Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
        6  Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
        7  And all the unlawful issue that their lust
        8  Since then hath made between them. Unto her
        9  He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
       10  Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
       11  Absolute queen.
    MECAENAS
       12  This in the public eye?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       13  I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
       14  His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
       15  Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
       16  He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
       17  Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
       18  In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
       19  That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
       20  As 'tis reported, so.
    MECAENAS
       21  Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
    AGRIPPA
       22  Who, queasy with his insolence
       23  Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       24  The people know it; and have now received
       25  His accusations.
    AGRIPPA
       26  Who does he accuse?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       27  Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
       28  Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
       29  His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
       30  Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
       31  That Lepidus of the triumvirate
       32  Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
       33  All his revenue.
    AGRIPPA
       34  Sir, this should be answer'd.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       35  'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
       36  I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
       37  That he his high authority abused,
       38  And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
       39  I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
       40  And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
       41  Demand the like.
    MECAENAS
       42  He'll never yield to that.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       43  Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIA with her train
    OCTAVIA
       44  Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       45  That ever I should call thee castaway!
    OCTAVIA
       46  You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       47  Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
       48  Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
       49  Should have an army for an usher, and
       50  The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
       51  Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
       52  Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
       53  Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
       54  Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
       55  Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
       56  A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
       57  The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
       58  Is often left unloved; we should have met you
       59  By sea and land; supplying every stage
       60  With an augmented greeting.
    OCTAVIA
       61  Good my lord,
       62  To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
       63  On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
       64  Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
       65  My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
       66  His pardon for return.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       67  Which soon he granted,
       68  Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
    OCTAVIA
       69  Do not say so, my lord.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       70  I have eyes upon him,
       71  And his affairs come to me on the wind.
       72  Where is he now?
    OCTAVIA
       73  My lord, in Athens.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       74  No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
       75  Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
       76  Up to a whore; who now are levying
       77  The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
       78  Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
       79  Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
       80  Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
       81  King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
       82  Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
       83  Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
       84  The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
       85  With a more larger list of sceptres.
    OCTAVIA
       86  Ay me, most wretched,
       87  That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
       88  That do afflict each other!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       89  Welcome hither:
       90  Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
       91  Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
       92  And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
       93  Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
       94  O'er your content these strong necessities;
       95  But let determined things to destiny
       96  Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
       97  Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
       98  Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
       99  To do you justice, make them ministers
      100  Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
      101  And ever welcome to us.
    AGRIPPA
      102  Welcome, lady.
    MECAENAS
      103  Welcome, dear madam.
      104  Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
      105  Only the adulterous Antony, most large
      106  In his abominations, turns you off;
      107  And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
      108  That noises it against us.
    OCTAVIA
      109  Is it so, sir?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      110  Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
      111  Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!
  Direction: Exeunt
