          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 6

SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
  Direction: Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, and others
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
        2  Our will is Antony be took alive;
        3  Make it so known.
    AGRIPPA
        4  Caesar, I shall.
  Direction: Exit
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        5  The time of universal peace is near:
        6  Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
        7  Shall bear the olive freely.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
        8  Antony
        9  Is come into the field.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       10  Go charge Agrippa
       11  Plant those that have revolted in the van,
       12  That Antony may seem to spend his fury
       13  Upon himself.
  Direction: Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       14  Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
       15  Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
       16  Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
       17  And leave his master Antony: for this pains
       18  Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
       19  That fell away have entertainment, but
       20  No honourable trust. I have done ill;
       21  Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
       22  That I will joy no more.
  Direction: Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's
    Soldier
       23  Enobarbus, Antony
       24  Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
       25  His bounty overplus: the messenger
       26  Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
       27  Unloading of his mules.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       28  I give it you.
    Soldier
       29  Mock not, Enobarbus.
       30  I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
       31  Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
       32  Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
       33  Continues still a Jove.
  Direction: Exit
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       34  I am alone the villain of the earth,
       35  And feel I am so most. O Antony,
       36  Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
       37  My better service, when my turpitude
       38  Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
       39  If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
       40  Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
       41  I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
       42  Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
       43  My latter part of life.
  Direction: Exit
