          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.
  Direction: Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS
    LEPIDUS
        1  Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
        2  And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
        3  To soft and gentle speech.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        4  I shall entreat him
        5  To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
        6  Let Antony look over Caesar's head
        7  And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
        8  Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
        9  I would not shave't to-day.
    LEPIDUS
       10  'Tis not a time
       11  For private stomaching.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       12  Every time
       13  Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
    LEPIDUS
       14  But small to greater matters must give way.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       15  Not if the small come first.
    LEPIDUS
       16  Your speech is passion:
       17  But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
       18  The noble Antony.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       19  And yonder, Caesar.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA
    MARK ANTONY
       20  If we compose well here, to Parthia:
       21  Hark, Ventidius.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       22  I do not know,
       23  Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.
    LEPIDUS
       24  Noble friends,
       25  That which combined us was most great, and let not
       26  A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
       27  May it be gently heard: when we debate
       28  Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
       29  Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
       30  The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
       31  Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
       32  Nor curstness grow to the matter.
    MARK ANTONY
       33  'Tis spoken well.
       34  Were we before our armies, and to fight.
       35  I should do thus.
  Direction: Flourish
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       36  Welcome to Rome.
    MARK ANTONY
       37  Thank you.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       38  Sit.
    MARK ANTONY
       39  Sit, sir.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       40  Nay, then.
    MARK ANTONY
       41  I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
       42  Or being, concern you not.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       43  I must be laugh'd at,
       44  If, or for nothing or a little, I
       45  Should say myself offended, and with you
       46  Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should
       47  Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
       48  It not concern'd me.
    MARK ANTONY
       49  My being in Egypt, Caesar,
       50  What was't to you?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       51  No more than my residing here at Rome
       52  Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there
       53  Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
       54  Might be my question.
    MARK ANTONY
       55  How intend you, practised?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       56  You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
       57  By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
       58  Made wars upon me; and their contestation
       59  Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
    MARK ANTONY
       60  You do mistake your business; my brother never
       61  Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
       62  And have my learning from some true reports,
       63  That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
       64  Discredit my authority with yours;
       65  And make the wars alike against my stomach,
       66  Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
       67  Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
       68  As matter whole you have not to make it with,
       69  It must not be with this.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       70  You praise yourself
       71  By laying defects of judgment to me; but
       72  You patch'd up your excuses.
    MARK ANTONY
       73  Not so, not so;
       74  I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
       75  Very necessity of this thought, that I,
       76  Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
       77  Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
       78  Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
       79  I would you had her spirit in such another:
       80  The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
       81  You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       82  Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
       83  to wars with the women!
    MARK ANTONY
       84  So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
       85  Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
       86  Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
       87  Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
       88  But say, I could not help it.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       89  I wrote to you
       90  When rioting in Alexandria; you
       91  Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
       92  Did gibe my missive out of audience.
    MARK ANTONY
       93  Sir,
       94  He fell upon me ere admitted: then
       95  Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
       96  Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
       97  I told him of myself; which was as much
       98  As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
       99  Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
      100  Out of our question wipe him.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      101  You have broken
      102  The article of your oath; which you shall never
      103  Have tongue to charge me with.
    LEPIDUS
      104  Soft, Caesar!
    MARK ANTONY
      105  No,
      106  Lepidus, let him speak:
      107  The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
      108  Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
      109  The article of my oath.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      110  To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
      111  The which you both denied.
    MARK ANTONY
      112  Neglected, rather;
      113  And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
      114  From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
      115  I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
      116  Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
      117  Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
      118  To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
      119  For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
      120  So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
      121  To stoop in such a case.
    LEPIDUS
      122  'Tis noble spoken.
    MECAENAS
      123  If it might please you, to enforce no further
      124  The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
      125  Were to remember that the present need
      126  Speaks to atone you.
    LEPIDUS
      127  Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      128  Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
      129  instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
      130  Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
      131  wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
    MARK ANTONY
      132  Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      133  That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
    MARK ANTONY
      134  You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      135  Go to, then; your considerate stone.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      136  I do not much dislike the matter, but
      137  The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
      138  We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
      139  So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
      140  What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
      141  O' the world I would pursue it.
    AGRIPPA
      142  Give me leave, Caesar,--
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      143  Speak, Agrippa.
    AGRIPPA
      144  Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
      145  Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
      146  Is now a widower.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      147  Say not so, Agrippa:
      148  If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
      149  Were well deserved of rashness.
    MARK ANTONY
      150  I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
      151  Agrippa further speak.
    AGRIPPA
      152  To hold you in perpetual amity,
      153  To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
      154  With an unslipping knot, take Antony
      155  Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
      156  No worse a husband than the best of men;
      157  Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
      158  That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
      159  All little jealousies, which now seem great,
      160  And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
      161  Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
      162  Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
      163  Would, each to other and all loves to both,
      164  Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
      165  For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
      166  By duty ruminated.
    MARK ANTONY
      167  Will Caesar speak?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      168  Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
      169  With what is spoke already.
    MARK ANTONY
      170  What power is in Agrippa,
      171  If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
      172  To make this good?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      173  The power of Caesar, and
      174  His power unto Octavia.
    MARK ANTONY
      175  May I never
      176  To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
      177  Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
      178  Further this act of grace: and from this hour
      179  The heart of brothers govern in our loves
      180  And sway our great designs!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      181  There is my hand.
      182  A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
      183  Did ever love so dearly: let her live
      184  To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
      185  Fly off our loves again!
    LEPIDUS
      186  Happily, amen!
    MARK ANTONY
      187  I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
      188  For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
      189  Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
      190  Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
      191  At heel of that, defy him.
    LEPIDUS
      192  Time calls upon's:
      193  Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
      194  Or else he seeks out us.
    MARK ANTONY
      195  Where lies he?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      196  About the mount Misenum.
    MARK ANTONY
      197  What is his strength by land?
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      198  Great and increasing: but by sea
      199  He is an absolute master.
    MARK ANTONY
      200  So is the fame.
      201  Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
      202  Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
      203  The business we have talk'd of.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      204  With most gladness:
      205  And do invite you to my sister's view,
      206  Whither straight I'll lead you.
    MARK ANTONY
      207  Let us, Lepidus,
      208  Not lack your company.
    LEPIDUS
      209  Noble Antony,
      210  Not sickness should detain me.
  Direction: Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS
    MECAENAS
      211  Welcome from Egypt, sir.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      212  Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
      213  honourable friend, Agrippa!
    AGRIPPA
      214  Good Enobarbus!
    MECAENAS
      215  We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
      216  digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      217  Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
      218  made the night light with drinking.
    MECAENAS
      219  Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
      220  but twelve persons there; is this true?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      221  This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
      222  monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
    MECAENAS
      223  She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
      224  her.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      225  When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
      226  his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
    AGRIPPA
      227  There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
      228  well for her.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      229  I will tell you.
      230  The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
      231  Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
      232  Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
      233  The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
      234  Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
      235  The water which they beat to follow faster,
      236  As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
      237  It beggar'd all description: she did lie
      238  In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
      239  O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
      240  The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
      241  Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
      242  With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
      243  To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
      244  And what they undid did.
    AGRIPPA
      245  O, rare for Antony!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      246  Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
      247  So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
      248  And made their bends adornings: at the helm
      249  A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
      250  Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
      251  That yarely frame the office. From the barge
      252  A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
      253  Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
      254  Her people out upon her; and Antony,
      255  Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
      256  Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
      257  Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
      258  And made a gap in nature.
    AGRIPPA
      259  Rare Egyptian!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      260  Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
      261  Invited her to supper: she replied,
      262  It should be better he became her guest;
      263  Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
      264  Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
      265  Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
      266  And for his ordinary pays his heart
      267  For what his eyes eat only.
    AGRIPPA
      268  Royal wench!
      269  She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
      270  He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      271  I saw her once
      272  Hop forty paces through the public street;
      273  And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
      274  That she did make defect perfection,
      275  And, breathless, power breathe forth.
    MECAENAS
      276  Now Antony must leave her utterly.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      277  Never; he will not:
      278  Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
      279  Her infinite variety: other women cloy
      280  The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
      281  Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
      282  Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
      283  Bless her when she is riggish.
    MECAENAS
      284  If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
      285  The heart of Antony, Octavia is
      286  A blessed lottery to him.
    AGRIPPA
      287  Let us go.
      288  Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
      289  Whilst you abide here.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      290  Humbly, sir, I thank you.
  Direction: Exeunt
