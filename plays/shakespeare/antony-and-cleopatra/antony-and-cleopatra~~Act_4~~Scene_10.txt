SCENE X. Between the two camps.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army
    MARK ANTONY
        1  Their preparation is to-day by sea;
        2  We please them not by land.
    SCARUS
        3  For both, my lord.
    MARK ANTONY
        4  I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
        5  We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
        6  Upon the hills adjoining to the city
        7  Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
        8  They have put forth the haven
        9  Where their appointment we may best discover,
       10  And look on their endeavour.
  Direction: Exeunt
