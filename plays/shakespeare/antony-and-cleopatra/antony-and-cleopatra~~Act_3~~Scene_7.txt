          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        2  But why, why, why?
    CLEOPATRA
        3  Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
        4  And say'st it is not fit.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        5  Well, is it, is it?
    CLEOPATRA
        6  If not denounced against us, why should not we
        7  Be there in person?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        8  [Aside] Well, I could reply:
        9  If we should serve with horse and mares together,
       10  The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
       11  A soldier and his horse.
    CLEOPATRA
       12  What is't you say?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       13  Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
       14  Take from his heart, take from his brain,
       15  from's time,
       16  What should not then be spared. He is already
       17  Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
       18  That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
       19  Manage this war.
    CLEOPATRA
       20  Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
       21  That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
       22  And, as the president of my kingdom, will
       23  Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
       24  I will not stay behind.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       25  Nay, I have done.
       26  Here comes the emperor.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS
    MARK ANTONY
       27  Is it not strange, Canidius,
       28  That from Tarentum and Brundusium
       29  He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
       30  And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?
    CLEOPATRA
       31  Celerity is never more admired
       32  Than by the negligent.
    MARK ANTONY
       33  A good rebuke,
       34  Which might have well becomed the best of men,
       35  To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
       36  Will fight with him by sea.
    CLEOPATRA
       37  By sea! what else?
    CANIDIUS
       38  Why will my lord do so?
    MARK ANTONY
       39  For that he dares us to't.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       40  So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
    CANIDIUS
       41  Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
       42  Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
       43  Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
       44  And so should you.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       45  Your ships are not well mann'd;
       46  Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
       47  Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
       48  Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
       49  Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
       50  Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
       51  Being prepared for land.
    MARK ANTONY
       52  By sea, by sea.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       53  Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
       54  The absolute soldiership you have by land;
       55  Distract your army, which doth most consist
       56  Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
       57  Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
       58  The way which promises assurance; and
       59  Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
       60  From firm security.
    MARK ANTONY
       61  I'll fight at sea.
    CLEOPATRA
       62  I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
    MARK ANTONY
       63  Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
       64  And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
       65  Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
       66  We then can do't at land.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
       67  Thy business?
    Messenger
       68  The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
       69  Caesar has taken Toryne.
    MARK ANTONY
       70  Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
       71  Strange that power should be. Canidius,
       72  Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
       73  And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
       74  Away, my Thetis!
  Direction: Enter a Soldier
       75  How now, worthy soldier?
    Soldier
       76  O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
       77  Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
       78  This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
       79  And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
       80  Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
       81  And fighting foot to foot.
    MARK ANTONY
       82  Well, well: away!
  Direction: Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    Soldier
       83  By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
    CANIDIUS
       84  Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
       85  Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
       86  And we are women's men.
    Soldier
       87  You keep by land
       88  The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
    CANIDIUS
       89  Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
       90  Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
       91  But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
       92  Carries beyond belief.
    Soldier
       93  While he was yet in Rome,
       94  His power went out in such distractions as
       95  Beguiled all spies.
    CANIDIUS
       96  Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
    Soldier
       97  They say, one Taurus.
    CANIDIUS
       98  Well I know the man.
  Direction: Enter a Messenger
    Messenger
       99  The emperor calls Canidius.
    CANIDIUS
      100  With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
      101  Each minute, some.
  Direction: Exeunt
