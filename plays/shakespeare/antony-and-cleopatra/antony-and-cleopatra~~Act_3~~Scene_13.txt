          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 13

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  What shall we do, Enobarbus?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        2  Think, and die.
    CLEOPATRA
        3  Is Antony or we in fault for this?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        4  Antony only, that would make his will
        5  Lord of his reason. What though you fled
        6  From that great face of war, whose several ranges
        7  Frighted each other? why should he follow?
        8  The itch of his affection should not then
        9  Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
       10  When half to half the world opposed, he being
       11  The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
       12  Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
       13  And leave his navy gazing.
    CLEOPATRA
       14  Prithee, peace.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador
    MARK ANTONY
       15  Is that his answer?
    EUPHRONIUS
       16  Ay, my lord.
    MARK ANTONY
       17  The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
       18  Will yield us up.
    EUPHRONIUS
       19  He says so.
    MARK ANTONY
       20  Let her know't.
       21  To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
       22  And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
       23  With principalities.
    CLEOPATRA
       24  That head, my lord?
    MARK ANTONY
       25  To him again: tell him he wears the rose
       26  Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
       27  Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
       28  May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
       29  Under the service of a child as soon
       30  As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
       31  To lay his gay comparisons apart,
       32  And answer me declined, sword against sword,
       33  Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
  Direction: Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       34  [Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
       35  Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
       36  Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
       37  A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
       38  Do draw the inward quality after them,
       39  To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
       40  Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
       41  Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
       42  His judgment too.
  Direction: Enter an Attendant
    Attendant
       43  A messenger from CAESAR.
    CLEOPATRA
       44  What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
       45  Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
       46  That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
  Direction: Exit Attendant
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       47  [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
       48  The loyalty well held to fools does make
       49  Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
       50  To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
       51  Does conquer him that did his master conquer
       52  And earns a place i' the story.
  Direction: Enter THYREUS
    CLEOPATRA
       53  Caesar's will?
    THYREUS
       54  Hear it apart.
    CLEOPATRA
       55  None but friends: say boldly.
    THYREUS
       56  So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       57  He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
       58  Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
       59  Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
       60  Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.
    THYREUS
       61  So.
       62  Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
       63  Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
       64  Further than he is Caesar.
    CLEOPATRA
       65  Go on: right royal.
    THYREUS
       66  He knows that you embrace not Antony
       67  As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
    CLEOPATRA
       68  O!
    THYREUS
       69  The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
       70  Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
       71  Not as deserved.
    CLEOPATRA
       72  He is a god, and knows
       73  What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
       74  But conquer'd merely.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       75  [Aside] To be sure of that,
       76  I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
       77  That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
       78  Thy dearest quit thee.
  Direction: Exit
    THYREUS
       79  Shall I say to Caesar
       80  What you require of him? for he partly begs
       81  To be desired to give. It much would please him,
       82  That of his fortunes you should make a staff
       83  To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
       84  To hear from me you had left Antony,
       85  And put yourself under his shrowd,
       86  The universal landlord.
    CLEOPATRA
       87  What's your name?
    THYREUS
       88  My name is Thyreus.
    CLEOPATRA
       89  Most kind messenger,
       90  Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
       91  I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
       92  To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
       93  Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
       94  The doom of Egypt.
    THYREUS
       95  'Tis your noblest course.
       96  Wisdom and fortune combating together,
       97  If that the former dare but what it can,
       98  No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
       99  My duty on your hand.
    CLEOPATRA
      100  Your Caesar's father oft,
      101  When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
      102  Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
      103  As it rain'd kisses.
  Direction: Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    MARK ANTONY
      104  Favours, by Jove that thunders!
      105  What art thou, fellow?
    THYREUS
      106  One that but performs
      107  The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
      108  To have command obey'd.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      109  [Aside] You will be whipp'd.
    MARK ANTONY
      110  Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
      111  and devils!
      112  Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
      113  Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
      114  And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
      115  Antony yet.
  Direction: Enter Attendants
      116  Take hence this Jack, and whip him.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      117  [Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
      118  Than with an old one dying.
    MARK ANTONY
      119  Moon and stars!
      120  Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
      121  That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
      122  So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
      123  Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
      124  Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
      125  And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.
    THYREUS
      126  Mark Antony!
    MARK ANTONY
      127  Tug him away: being whipp'd,
      128  Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
      129  Bear us an errand to him.
  Direction: Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
      130  You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
      131  Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
      132  Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
      133  And by a gem of women, to be abused
      134  By one that looks on feeders?
    CLEOPATRA
      135  Good my lord,--
    MARK ANTONY
      136  You have been a boggler ever:
      137  But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
      138  O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
      139  In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
      140  Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
      141  To our confusion.
    CLEOPATRA
      142  O, is't come to this?
    MARK ANTONY
      143  I found you as a morsel cold upon
      144  Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
      145  Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
      146  Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
      147  Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
      148  Though you can guess what temperance should be,
      149  You know not what it is.
    CLEOPATRA
      150  Wherefore is this?
    MARK ANTONY
      151  To let a fellow that will take rewards
      152  And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
      153  My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
      154  And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
      155  Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
      156  The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
      157  And to proclaim it civilly, were like
      158  A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
      159  For being yare about him.
  Direction: Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
      160  Is he whipp'd?
    First Attendant
      161  Soundly, my lord.
    MARK ANTONY
      162  Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
    First Attendant
      163  He did ask favour.
    MARK ANTONY
      164  If that thy father live, let him repent
      165  Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
      166  To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
      167  Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
      168  The white hand of a lady fever thee,
      169  Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
      170  Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
      171  He makes me angry with him; for he seems
      172  Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
      173  Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
      174  And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
      175  When my good stars, that were my former guides,
      176  Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
      177  Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
      178  My speech and what is done, tell him he has
      179  Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
      180  He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
      181  As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
      182  Hence with thy stripes, begone!
  Direction: Exit THYREUS
    CLEOPATRA
      183  Have you done yet?
    MARK ANTONY
      184  Alack, our terrene moon
      185  Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
      186  The fall of Antony!
    CLEOPATRA
      187  I must stay his time.
    MARK ANTONY
      188  To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
      189  With one that ties his points?
    CLEOPATRA
      190  Not know me yet?
    MARK ANTONY
      191  Cold-hearted toward me?
    CLEOPATRA
      192  Ah, dear, if I be so,
      193  From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
      194  And poison it in the source; and the first stone
      195  Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
      196  Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
      197  Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
      198  Together with my brave Egyptians all,
      199  By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
      200  Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
      201  Have buried them for prey!
    MARK ANTONY
      202  I am satisfied.
      203  Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
      204  I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
      205  Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
      206  Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
      207  Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
      208  If from the field I shall return once more
      209  To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
      210  I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
      211  There's hope in't yet.
    CLEOPATRA
      212  That's my brave lord!
    MARK ANTONY
      213  I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
      214  And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
      215  Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
      216  Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
      217  And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
      218  Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
      219  All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
      220  Let's mock the midnight bell.
    CLEOPATRA
      221  It is my birth-day:
      222  I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
      223  Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
    MARK ANTONY
      224  We will yet do well.
    CLEOPATRA
      225  Call all his noble captains to my lord.
    MARK ANTONY
      226  Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
      227  The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
      228  There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
      229  I'll make death love me; for I will contend
      230  Even with his pestilent scythe.
  Direction: Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      231  Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
      232  Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
      233  The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
      234  A diminution in our captain's brain
      235  Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
      236  It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
      237  Some way to leave him.
  Direction: Exit
