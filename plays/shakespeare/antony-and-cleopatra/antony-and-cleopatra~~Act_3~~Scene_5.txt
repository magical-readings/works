          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 5

SCENE V. The same. Another room.
  Direction: Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        1  How now, friend Eros!
    EROS
        2  There's strange news come, sir.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        3  What, man?
    EROS
        4  Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        5  This is old: what is the success?
    EROS
        6  Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
        7  Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
        8  him partake in the glory of the action: and not
        9  resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
       10  wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
       11  the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       12  Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
       13  And throw between them all the food thou hast,
       14  They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
    EROS
       15  He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
       16  The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
       17  And threats the throat of that his officer
       18  That murder'd Pompey.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       19  Our great navy's rigg'd.
    EROS
       20  For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
       21  My lord desires you presently: my news
       22  I might have told hereafter.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       23  'Twill be naught:
       24  But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
    EROS
       25  Come, sir.
  Direction: Exeunt
