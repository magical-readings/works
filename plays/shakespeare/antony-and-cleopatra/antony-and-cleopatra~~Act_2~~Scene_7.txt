          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 7

SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.
  Direction: Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet
    First Servant
        1  Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
        2  ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
        3  will blow them down.
    Second Servant
        4  Lepidus is high-coloured.
    First Servant
        5  They have made him drink alms-drink.
    Second Servant
        6  As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
        7  cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
        8  entreaty, and himself to the drink.
    First Servant
        9  But it raises the greater war between him and
       10  his discretion.
    Second Servant
       11  Why, this is to have a name in great men's
       12  fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
       13  me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
    First Servant
       14  To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
       15  to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
       16  which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
  Direction: A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains
    MARK ANTONY
       17  [To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
       18  the flow o' the Nile
       19  By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
       20  By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
       21  Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
       22  The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
       23  Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
       24  And shortly comes to harvest.
    LEPIDUS
       25  You've strange serpents there.
    MARK ANTONY
       26  Ay, Lepidus.
    LEPIDUS
       27  Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
       28  operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
    MARK ANTONY
       29  They are so.
    POMPEY
       30  Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
    LEPIDUS
       31  I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       32  Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
    LEPIDUS
       33  Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
       34  pyramises are very goodly things; without
       35  contradiction, I have heard that.
    MENAS
       36  [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.
    POMPEY
       37  [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
       38  what is't?
    MENAS
       39  [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
       40  thee, captain,
       41  And hear me speak a word.
    POMPEY
       42  [Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
       43  This wine for Lepidus!
    LEPIDUS
       44  What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
    MARK ANTONY
       45  It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
       46  as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
       47  and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
       48  which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
       49  it, it transmigrates.
    LEPIDUS
       50  What colour is it of?
    MARK ANTONY
       51  Of it own colour too.
    LEPIDUS
       52  'Tis a strange serpent.
    MARK ANTONY
       53  'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       54  Will this description satisfy him?
    MARK ANTONY
       55  With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
       56  very epicure.
    POMPEY
       57  [Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
       58  that? away!
       59  Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
    MENAS
       60  [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
       61  wilt hear me,
       62  Rise from thy stool.
    POMPEY
       63  [Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
       64  The matter?
  Direction: Rises, and walks aside
    MENAS
       65  I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
    POMPEY
       66  Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
       67  Be jolly, lords.
    MARK ANTONY
       68  These quick-sands, Lepidus,
       69  Keep off them, for you sink.
    MENAS
       70  Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
    POMPEY
       71  What say'st thou?
    MENAS
       72  Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
    POMPEY
       73  How should that be?
    MENAS
       74  But entertain it,
       75  And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
       76  Will give thee all the world.
    POMPEY
       77  Hast thou drunk well?
    MENAS
       78  Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
       79  Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
       80  Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
       81  Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
    POMPEY
       82  Show me which way.
    MENAS
       83  These three world-sharers, these competitors,
       84  Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
       85  And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
       86  All there is thine.
    POMPEY
       87  Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
       88  And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
       89  In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
       90  'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
       91  Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
       92  Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
       93  I should have found it afterwards well done;
       94  But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
    MENAS
       95  [Aside] For this,
       96  I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
       97  Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
       98  Shall never find it more.
    POMPEY
       99  This health to Lepidus!
    MARK ANTONY
      100  Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      101  Here's to thee, Menas!
    MENAS
      102  Enobarbus, welcome!
    POMPEY
      103  Fill till the cup be hid.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      104  There's a strong fellow, Menas.
  Direction: Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS
    MENAS
      105  Why?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      106  A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
      107  not?
    MENAS
      108  The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
      109  That it might go on wheels!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      110  Drink thou; increase the reels.
    MENAS
      111  Come.
    POMPEY
      112  This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
    MARK ANTONY
      113  It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
      114  Here is to Caesar!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      115  I could well forbear't.
      116  It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
      117  And it grows fouler.
    MARK ANTONY
      118  Be a child o' the time.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      119  Possess it, I'll make answer:
      120  But I had rather fast from all four days
      121  Than drink so much in one.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      122  Ha, my brave emperor!
  Direction: To MARK ANTONY
      123  Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
      124  And celebrate our drink?
    POMPEY
      125  Let's ha't, good soldier.
    MARK ANTONY
      126  Come, let's all take hands,
      127  Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
      128  In soft and delicate Lethe.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      129  All take hands.
      130  Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
      131  The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
      132  The holding every man shall bear as loud
      133  As his strong sides can volley.
  Direction: Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
      134  THE SONG.
      135  Come, thou monarch of the vine,
      136  Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
      137  In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
      138  With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
      139  Cup us, till the world go round,
      140  Cup us, till the world go round!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
      141  What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
      142  Let me request you off: our graver business
      143  Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
      144  You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
      145  Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
      146  Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
      147  Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
      148  Good Antony, your hand.
    POMPEY
      149  I'll try you on the shore.
    MARK ANTONY
      150  And shall, sir; give's your hand.
    POMPEY
      151  O Antony,
      152  You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
      153  Come, down into the boat.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      154  Take heed you fall not.
  Direction: Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
      155  Menas, I'll not on shore.
    MENAS
      156  No, to my cabin.
      157  These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
      158  Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
      159  To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
  Direction: Sound a flourish, with drums
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      160  Ho! says a' There's my cap.
    MENAS
      161  Ho! Noble captain, come.
  Direction: Exeunt
