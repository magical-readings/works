          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 2 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.
  Direction: Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner
    POMPEY
        1  If the great gods be just, they shall assist
        2  The deeds of justest men.
    MENECRATES
        3  Know, worthy Pompey,
        4  That what they do delay, they not deny.
    POMPEY
        5  Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
        6  The thing we sue for.
    MENECRATES
        7  We, ignorant of ourselves,
        8  Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
        9  Deny us for our good; so find we profit
       10  By losing of our prayers.
    POMPEY
       11  I shall do well:
       12  The people love me, and the sea is mine;
       13  My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
       14  Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
       15  In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
       16  No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
       17  He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
       18  Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
       19  Nor either cares for him.
    MENAS
       20  Caesar and Lepidus
       21  Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
    POMPEY
       22  Where have you this? 'tis false.
    MENAS
       23  From Silvius, sir.
    POMPEY
       24  He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
       25  Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
       26  Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
       27  Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
       28  Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
       29  Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
       30  Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
       31  That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
       32  Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
  Direction: Enter VARRIUS
       33  How now, Varrius!
    VARRIUS
       34  This is most certain that I shall deliver:
       35  Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
       36  Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
       37  A space for further travel.
    POMPEY
       38  I could have given less matter
       39  A better ear. Menas, I did not think
       40  This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
       41  For such a petty war: his soldiership
       42  Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
       43  The higher our opinion, that our stirring
       44  Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
       45  The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
    MENAS
       46  I cannot hope
       47  Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
       48  His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
       49  His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
       50  Not moved by Antony.
    POMPEY
       51  I know not, Menas,
       52  How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
       53  Were't not that we stand up against them all,
       54  'Twere pregnant they should square between
       55  themselves;
       56  For they have entertained cause enough
       57  To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
       58  May cement their divisions and bind up
       59  The petty difference, we yet not know.
       60  Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
       61  Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
       62  Come, Menas.
  Direction: Exeunt
