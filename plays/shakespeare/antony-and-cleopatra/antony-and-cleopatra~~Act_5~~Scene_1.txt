          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 5 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
        2  Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
        3  The pauses that he makes.
    DOLABELLA
        4  Caesar, I shall.
  Direction: Exit
  Direction: Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        5  Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
        6  Appear thus to us?
    DERCETAS
        7  I am call'd Dercetas;
        8  Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
        9  Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
       10  He was my master; and I wore my life
       11  To spend upon his haters. If thou please
       12  To take me to thee, as I was to him
       13  I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
       14  I yield thee up my life.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       15  What is't thou say'st?
    DERCETAS
       16  I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       17  The breaking of so great a thing should make
       18  A greater crack: the round world
       19  Should have shook lions into civil streets,
       20  And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
       21  Is not a single doom; in the name lay
       22  A moiety of the world.
    DERCETAS
       23  He is dead, Caesar:
       24  Not by a public minister of justice,
       25  Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
       26  Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
       27  Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
       28  Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
       29  I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
       30  With his most noble blood.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       31  Look you sad, friends?
       32  The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
       33  To wash the eyes of kings.
    AGRIPPA
       34  And strange it is,
       35  That nature must compel us to lament
       36  Our most persisted deeds.
    MECAENAS
       37  His taints and honours
       38  Waged equal with him.
    AGRIPPA
       39  A rarer spirit never
       40  Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
       41  Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
    MECAENAS
       42  When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
       43  He needs must see himself.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       44  O Antony!
       45  I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
       46  Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
       47  Have shown to thee such a declining day,
       48  Or look on thine; we could not stall together
       49  In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
       50  With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
       51  That thou, my brother, my competitor
       52  In top of all design, my mate in empire,
       53  Friend and companion in the front of war,
       54  The arm of mine own body, and the heart
       55  Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
       56  Unreconciliable, should divide
       57  Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
       58  But I will tell you at some meeter season:
  Direction: Enter an Egyptian
       59  The business of this man looks out of him;
       60  We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
    Egyptian
       61  A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
       62  Confined in all she has, her monument,
       63  Of thy intents desires instruction,
       64  That she preparedly may frame herself
       65  To the way she's forced to.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       66  Bid her have good heart:
       67  She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
       68  How honourable and how kindly we
       69  Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
       70  To be ungentle.
    Egyptian
       71  So the gods preserve thee!
  Direction: Exit
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       72  Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
       73  We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
       74  The quality of her passion shall require,
       75  Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
       76  She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
       77  Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
       78  And with your speediest bring us what she says,
       79  And how you find of her.
    PROCULEIUS
       80  Caesar, I shall.
  Direction: Exit
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       81  Gallus, go you along.
  Direction: Exit GALLUS
       82  Where's Dolabella,
       83  To second Proculeius?
    All
       84  Dolabella!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       85  Let him alone, for I remember now
       86  How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
       87  Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
       88  How hardly I was drawn into this war;
       89  How calm and gentle I proceeded still
       90  In all my writings: go with me, and see
       91  What I can show in this.
  Direction: Exeunt
