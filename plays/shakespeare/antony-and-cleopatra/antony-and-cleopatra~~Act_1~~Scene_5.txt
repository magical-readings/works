          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 1 : Scene 5

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
    CLEOPATRA
        1  Charmian!
    CHARMIAN
        2  Madam?
    CLEOPATRA
        3  Ha, ha!
        4  Give me to drink mandragora.
    CHARMIAN
        5  Why, madam?
    CLEOPATRA
        6  That I might sleep out this great gap of time
        7  My Antony is away.
    CHARMIAN
        8  You think of him too much.
    CLEOPATRA
        9  O, 'tis treason!
    CHARMIAN
       10  Madam, I trust, not so.
    CLEOPATRA
       11  Thou, eunuch Mardian!
    MARDIAN
       12  What's your highness' pleasure?
    CLEOPATRA
       13  Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
       14  In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
       15  That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
       16  May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
    MARDIAN
       17  Yes, gracious madam.
    CLEOPATRA
       18  Indeed!
    MARDIAN
       19  Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
       20  But what indeed is honest to be done:
       21  Yet have I fierce affections, and think
       22  What Venus did with Mars.
    CLEOPATRA
       23  O Charmian,
       24  Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
       25  Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
       26  O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
       27  Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
       28  The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
       29  And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
       30  Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
       31  For so he calls me: now I feed myself
       32  With most delicious poison. Think on me,
       33  That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
       34  And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
       35  When thou wast here above the ground, I was
       36  A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
       37  Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
       38  There would he anchor his aspect and die
       39  With looking on his life.
  Direction: Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR
    ALEXAS
       40  Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
    CLEOPATRA
       41  How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
       42  Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
       43  With his tinct gilded thee.
       44  How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
    ALEXAS
       45  Last thing he did, dear queen,
       46  He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
       47  This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
    CLEOPATRA
       48  Mine ear must pluck it thence.
    ALEXAS
       49  'Good friend,' quoth he,
       50  'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
       51  This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
       52  To mend the petty present, I will piece
       53  Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
       54  Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
       55  And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
       56  Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
       57  Was beastly dumb'd by him.
    CLEOPATRA
       58  What, was he sad or merry?
    ALEXAS
       59  Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
       60  Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
    CLEOPATRA
       61  O well-divided disposition! Note him,
       62  Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
       63  He was not sad, for he would shine on those
       64  That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
       65  Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
       66  In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
       67  O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
       68  The violence of either thee becomes,
       69  So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
    ALEXAS
       70  Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
       71  Why do you send so thick?
    CLEOPATRA
       72  Who's born that day
       73  When I forget to send to Antony,
       74  Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
       75  Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
       76  Ever love Caesar so?
    CHARMIAN
       77  O that brave Caesar!
    CLEOPATRA
       78  Be choked with such another emphasis!
       79  Say, the brave Antony.
    CHARMIAN
       80  The valiant Caesar!
    CLEOPATRA
       81  By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
       82  If thou with Caesar paragon again
       83  My man of men.
    CHARMIAN
       84  By your most gracious pardon,
       85  I sing but after you.
    CLEOPATRA
       86  My salad days,
       87  When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
       88  To say as I said then! But, come, away;
       89  Get me ink and paper:
       90  He shall have every day a several greeting,
       91  Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
  Direction: Exeunt
