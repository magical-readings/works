          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 2

SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
  Direction: Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another
    AGRIPPA
        1  What, are the brothers parted?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        2  They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
        3  The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
        4  To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
        5  Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
        6  With the green sickness.
    AGRIPPA
        7  'Tis a noble Lepidus.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
        8  A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
    AGRIPPA
        9  Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       10  Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
    AGRIPPA
       11  What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       12  Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
    AGRIPPA
       13  O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       14  Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
    AGRIPPA
       15  Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       16  But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
       17  Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
       18  poets, cannot
       19  Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
       20  His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
       21  Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
    AGRIPPA
       22  Both he loves.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       23  They are his shards, and he their beetle.
  Direction: Trumpets within
       24  So;
       25  This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
    AGRIPPA
       26  Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA
    MARK ANTONY
       27  No further, sir.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       28  You take from me a great part of myself;
       29  Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
       30  As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
       31  Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
       32  Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
       33  Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
       34  To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
       35  The fortress of it; for better might we
       36  Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
       37  This be not cherish'd.
    MARK ANTONY
       38  Make me not offended
       39  In your distrust.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       40  I have said.
    MARK ANTONY
       41  You shall not find,
       42  Though you be therein curious, the least cause
       43  For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
       44  And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
       45  We will here part.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       46  Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
       47  The elements be kind to thee, and make
       48  Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
    OCTAVIA
       49  My noble brother!
    MARK ANTONY
       50  The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
       51  And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
    OCTAVIA
       52  Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       53  What, Octavia?
    OCTAVIA
       54  I'll tell you in your ear.
    MARK ANTONY
       55  Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
       56  Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
       57  down-feather,
       58  That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
       59  And neither way inclines.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       60  [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?
    AGRIPPA
       61  [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       62  [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
       63  were he a horse;
       64  So is he, being a man.
    AGRIPPA
       65  [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
       66  When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
       67  He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
       68  When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       69  [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
       70  troubled with a rheum;
       71  What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
       72  Believe't, till I wept too.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       73  No, sweet Octavia,
       74  You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
       75  Out-go my thinking on you.
    MARK ANTONY
       76  Come, sir, come;
       77  I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
       78  Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
       79  And give you to the gods.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       80  Adieu; be happy!
    LEPIDUS
       81  Let all the number of the stars give light
       82  To thy fair way!
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       83  Farewell, fa rewell!
  Direction: Kisses OCTAVIA
    MARK ANTONY
       84  Farewell!
  Direction: Trumpets sound. Exeunt
