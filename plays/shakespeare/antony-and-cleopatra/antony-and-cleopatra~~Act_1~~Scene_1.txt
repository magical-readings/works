          Antony And Cleopatra : Act 1 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO
    PHILO
        1  Nay, but this dotage of our general's
        2  O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
        3  That o'er the files and musters of the war
        4  Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
        5  The office and devotion of their view
        6  Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
        7  Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
        8  The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
        9  And is become the bellows and the fan
       10  To cool a gipsy's lust.
  Direction: Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her
       11  Look, where they come:
       12  Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
       13  The triple pillar of the world transform'd
       14  Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
    CLEOPATRA
       15  If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
    MARK ANTONY
       16  There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
    CLEOPATRA
       17  I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
    MARK ANTONY
       18  Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
  Direction: Enter an Attendant
    Attendant
       19  News, my good lord, from Rome.
    MARK ANTONY
       20  Grates me: the sum.
    CLEOPATRA
       21  Nay, hear them, Antony:
       22  Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
       23  If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
       24  His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
       25  Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
       26  Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
    MARK ANTONY
       27  How, my love!
    CLEOPATRA
       28  Perchance! nay, and most like:
       29  You must not stay here longer, your dismission
       30  Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
       31  Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
       32  Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
       33  Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
       34  Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
       35  When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
    MARK ANTONY
       36  Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
       37  Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
       38  Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
       39  Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
       40  Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
  Direction: Embracing
       41  And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
       42  On pain of punishment, the world to weet
       43  We stand up peerless.
    CLEOPATRA
       44  Excellent falsehood!
       45  Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
       46  I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
       47  Will be himself.
    MARK ANTONY
       48  But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
       49  Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
       50  Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
       51  There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
       52  Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
    CLEOPATRA
       53  Hear the ambassadors.
    MARK ANTONY
       54  Fie, wrangling queen!
       55  Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
       56  To weep; whose every passion fully strives
       57  To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
       58  No messenger, but thine; and all alone
       59  To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
       60  The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
       61  Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
  Direction: Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train
    DEMETRIUS
       62  Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
    PHILO
       63  Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
       64  He comes too short of that great property
       65  Which still should go with Antony.
    DEMETRIUS
       66  I am full sorry
       67  That he approves the common liar, who
       68  Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
       69  Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
  Direction: Exeunt
