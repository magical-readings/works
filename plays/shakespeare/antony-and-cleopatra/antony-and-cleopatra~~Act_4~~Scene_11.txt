SCENE XI. Another part of the same.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  But being charged, we will be still by land,
        2  Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
        3  Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
        4  And hold our best advantage.
  Direction: Exeunt
