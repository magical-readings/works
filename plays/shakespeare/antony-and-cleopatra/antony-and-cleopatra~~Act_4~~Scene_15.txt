          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 15

SCENE XV. The same. A monument.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS
    CLEOPATRA
        1  O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
    CHARMIAN
        2  Be comforted, dear madam.
    CLEOPATRA
        3  No, I will not:
        4  All strange and terrible events are welcome,
        5  But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
        6  Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
        7  As that which makes it.
  Direction: Enter, below, DIOMEDES
        8  How now! is he dead?
    DIOMEDES
        9  His death's upon him, but not dead.
       10  Look out o' the other side your monument;
       11  His guard have brought him thither.
  Direction: Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard
    CLEOPATRA
       12  O sun,
       13  Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
       14  darkling stand
       15  The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
       16  Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
       17  Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.
    MARK ANTONY
       18  Peace!
       19  Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
       20  But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
    CLEOPATRA
       21  So it should be, that none but Antony
       22  Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
    MARK ANTONY
       23  I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
       24  I here importune death awhile, until
       25  Of many thousand kisses the poor last
       26  I lay up thy lips.
    CLEOPATRA
       27  I dare not, dear,--
       28  Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
       29  Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
       30  Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
       31  Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
       32  serpents, have
       33  Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
       34  Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
       35  And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
       36  Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
       37  Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
       38  Assist, good friends.
    MARK ANTONY
       39  O, quick, or I am gone.
    CLEOPATRA
       40  Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
       41  Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
       42  That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
       43  The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
       44  And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
       45  Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;
  Direction: They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
       46  And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
       47  Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
       48  Thus would I wear them out.
    All
       49  A heavy sight!
    MARK ANTONY
       50  I am dying, Egypt, dying:
       51  Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
    CLEOPATRA
       52  No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
       53  That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
       54  Provoked by my offence.
    MARK ANTONY
       55  One word, sweet queen:
       56  Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
    CLEOPATRA
       57  They do not go together.
    MARK ANTONY
       58  Gentle, hear me:
       59  None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
    CLEOPATRA
       60  My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
       61  None about Caesar.
    MARK ANTONY
       62  The miserable change now at my end
       63  Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
       64  In feeding them with those my former fortunes
       65  Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
       66  The noblest; and do now not basely die,
       67  Not cowardly put off my helmet to
       68  My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
       69  Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
       70  I can no more.
    CLEOPATRA
       71  Noblest of men, woo't die?
       72  Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
       73  In this dull world, which in thy absence is
       74  No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
  Direction: MARK ANTONY dies
       75  The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
       76  O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
       77  The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
       78  Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
       79  And there is nothing left remarkable
       80  Beneath the visiting moon.
  Direction: Faints
    CHARMIAN
       81  O, quietness, lady!
    IRAS
       82  She is dead too, our sovereign.
    CHARMIAN
       83  Lady!
    IRAS
       84  Madam!
    CHARMIAN
       85  O madam, madam, madam!
    IRAS
       86  Royal Egypt, Empress!
    CHARMIAN
       87  Peace, peace, Iras!
    CLEOPATRA
       88  No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
       89  By such poor passion as the maid that milks
       90  And does the meanest chares. It were for me
       91  To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
       92  To tell them that this world did equal theirs
       93  Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
       94  Patience is scottish, and impatience does
       95  Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
       96  To rush into the secret house of death,
       97  Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
       98  What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
       99  My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
      100  Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
      101  We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
      102  what's noble,
      103  Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
      104  And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
      105  This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
      106  Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
      107  But resolution, and the briefest end.
  Direction: Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body
