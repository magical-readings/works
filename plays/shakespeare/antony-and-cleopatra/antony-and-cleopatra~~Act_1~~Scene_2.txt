          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 1 : Scene 2

SCENE II. The same. Another room.
  Direction: Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer
    CHARMIAN
        1  Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
        2  almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
        3  that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
        4  this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
        5  with garlands!
    ALEXAS
        6  Soothsayer!
    Soothsayer
        7  Your will?
    CHARMIAN
        8  Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
    Soothsayer
        9  In nature's infinite book of secrecy
       10  A little I can read.
    ALEXAS
       11  Show him your hand.
  Direction: Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       12  Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
       13  Cleopatra's health to drink.
    CHARMIAN
       14  Good sir, give me good fortune.
    Soothsayer
       15  I make not, but foresee.
    CHARMIAN
       16  Pray, then, foresee me one.
    Soothsayer
       17  You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
    CHARMIAN
       18  He means in flesh.
    IRAS
       19  No, you shall paint when you are old.
    CHARMIAN
       20  Wrinkles forbid!
    ALEXAS
       21  Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
    CHARMIAN
       22  Hush!
    Soothsayer
       23  You shall be more beloving than beloved.
    CHARMIAN
       24  I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
    ALEXAS
       25  Nay, hear him.
    CHARMIAN
       26  Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
       27  to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
       28  let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
       29  may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
       30  Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
    Soothsayer
       31  You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
    CHARMIAN
       32  O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
    Soothsayer
       33  You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
       34  Than that which is to approach.
    CHARMIAN
       35  Then belike my children shall have no names:
       36  prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
    Soothsayer
       37  If every of your wishes had a womb.
       38  And fertile every wish, a million.
    CHARMIAN
       39  Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
    ALEXAS
       40  You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
    CHARMIAN
       41  Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
    ALEXAS
       42  We'll know all our fortunes.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       43  Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
       44  be--drunk to bed.
    IRAS
       45  There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
    CHARMIAN
       46  E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
    IRAS
       47  Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
    CHARMIAN
       48  Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
       49  prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
       50  tell her but a worky-day fortune.
    Soothsayer
       51  Your fortunes are alike.
    IRAS
       52  But how, but how? give me particulars.
    Soothsayer
       53  I have said.
    IRAS
       54  Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
    CHARMIAN
       55  Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
       56  I, where would you choose it?
    IRAS
       57  Not in my husband's nose.
    CHARMIAN
       58  Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
       59  his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
       60  that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
       61  her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
       62  follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
       63  laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
       64  Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
       65  matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
    IRAS
       66  Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
       67  for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
       68  loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
       69  foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
       70  decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
    CHARMIAN
       71  Amen.
    ALEXAS
       72  Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
       73  cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
       74  they'ld do't!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       75  Hush! here comes Antony.
    CHARMIAN
       76  Not he; the queen.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA
    CLEOPATRA
       77  Saw you my lord?
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       78  No, lady.
    CLEOPATRA
       79  Was he not here?
    CHARMIAN
       80  No, madam.
    CLEOPATRA
       81  He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
       82  A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
       83  Madam?
    CLEOPATRA
       84  Seek him, and bring him hither.
       85  Where's Alexas?
    ALEXAS
       86  Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
    CLEOPATRA
       87  We will not look upon him: go with us.
  Direction: Exeunt
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants
    Messenger
       88  Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
    MARK ANTONY
       89  Against my brother Lucius?
    Messenger
       90  Ay:
       91  But soon that war had end, and the time's state
       92  Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
       93  Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
       94  Upon the first encounter, drave them.
    MARK ANTONY
       95  Well, what worst?
    Messenger
       96  The nature of bad news infects the teller.
    MARK ANTONY
       97  When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
       98  Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
       99  Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
      100  I hear him as he flatter'd.
    Messenger
      101  Labienus--
      102  This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
      103  Extended Asia from Euphrates;
      104  His conquering banner shook from Syria
      105  To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
    MARK ANTONY
      106  Antony, thou wouldst say,--
    Messenger
      107  O, my lord!
    MARK ANTONY
      108  Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
      109  Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
      110  Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
      111  With such full licence as both truth and malice
      112  Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
      113  When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
      114  Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
    Messenger
      115  At your noble pleasure.
  Direction: Exit
    MARK ANTONY
      116  From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
    First Attendant
      117  The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
    Second Attendant
      118  He stays upon your will.
    MARK ANTONY
      119  Let him appear.
      120  These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
      121  Or lose myself in dotage.
  Direction: Enter another Messenger
      122  What are you?
    Second Messenger
      123  Fulvia thy wife is dead.
    MARK ANTONY
      124  Where died she?
    Second Messenger
      125  In Sicyon:
      126  Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
      127  Importeth thee to know, this bears.
  Direction: Gives a letter
    MARK ANTONY
      128  Forbear me.
  Direction: Exit Second Messenger
      129  There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
      130  What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
      131  We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
      132  By revolution lowering, does become
      133  The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
      134  The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
      135  I must from this enchanting queen break off:
      136  Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
      137  My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
  Direction: Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      138  What's your pleasure, sir?
    MARK ANTONY
      139  I must with haste from hence.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      140  Why, then, we kill all our women:
      141  we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
      142  if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
    MARK ANTONY
      143  I must be gone.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      144  Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
      145  pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
      146  them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
      147  nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
      148  this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
      149  times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
      150  mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
      151  her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
    MARK ANTONY
      152  She is cunning past man's thought.
  Direction: Exit ALEXAS
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      153  Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
      154  the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
      155  winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
      156  storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
      157  cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
      158  shower of rain as well as Jove.
    MARK ANTONY
      159  Would I had never seen her.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      160  O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
      161  of work; which not to have been blest withal would
      162  have discredited your travel.
    MARK ANTONY
      163  Fulvia is dead.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      164  Sir?
    MARK ANTONY
      165  Fulvia is dead.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      166  Fulvia!
    MARK ANTONY
      167  Dead.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      168  Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
      169  it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
      170  from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
      171  comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
      172  out, there are members to make new. If there were
      173  no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
      174  and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
      175  with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
      176  petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
      177  that should water this sorrow.
    MARK ANTONY
      178  The business she hath broached in the state
      179  Cannot endure my absence.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      180  And the business you have broached here cannot be
      181  without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
      182  wholly depends on your abode.
    MARK ANTONY
      183  No more light answers. Let our officers
      184  Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
      185  The cause of our expedience to the queen,
      186  And get her leave to part. For not alone
      187  The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
      188  Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
      189  Of many our contriving friends in Rome
      190  Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
      191  Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
      192  The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
      193  Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
      194  Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
      195  Pompey the Great and all his dignities
      196  Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
      197  Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
      198  For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
      199  The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
      200  Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
      201  And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
      202  To such whose place is under us, requires
      203  Our quick remove from hence.
    DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
      204  I shall do't.
  Direction: Exeunt
