          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 4

SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending
    MARK ANTONY
        1  Eros! mine armour, Eros!
    CLEOPATRA
        2  Sleep a little.
    MARK ANTONY
        3  No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
  Direction: Enter EROS with armour
        4  Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
        5  If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
        6  Because we brave her: come.
    CLEOPATRA
        7  Nay, I'll help too.
        8  What's this for?
    MARK ANTONY
        9  Ah, let be, let be! thou art
       10  The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.
    CLEOPATRA
       11  Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
    MARK ANTONY
       12  Well, well;
       13  We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
       14  Go put on thy defences.
    EROS
       15  Briefly, sir.
    CLEOPATRA
       16  Is not this buckled well?
    MARK ANTONY
       17  Rarely, rarely:
       18  He that unbuckles this, till we do please
       19  To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
       20  Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
       21  More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
       22  That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
       23  The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
       24  A workman in't.
  Direction: Enter an armed Soldier
       25  Good morrow to thee; welcome:
       26  Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
       27  To business that we love we rise betime,
       28  And go to't with delight.
    Soldier
       29  A thousand, sir,
       30  Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
       31  And at the port expect you.
  Direction: Shout. Trumpets flourish
  Direction: Enter Captains and Soldiers
    Captain
       32  The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.
    All
       33  Good morrow, general.
    MARK ANTONY
       34  'Tis well blown, lads:
       35  This morning, like the spirit of a youth
       36  That means to be of note, begins betimes.
       37  So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
       38  Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
       39  This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
  Direction: Kisses her
       40  And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
       41  On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
       42  Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
       43  Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.
  Direction: Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers
    CHARMIAN
       44  Please you, retire to your chamber.
    CLEOPATRA
       45  Lead me.
       46  He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
       47  Determine this great war in single fight!
       48  Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
  Direction: Exeunt
