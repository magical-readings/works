To simplify the programming of 'Magical Readings', sections of plays labelled
'Prolog' or 'Induction' are given appropriate act or scene numbers.

For example:

Romeo and Juliet
----------------
Act 1, Prologue: 
- say: "Go to Act 1, Scene 0"
Act 2, Prologue: 
- say: "Go to Act 2, Scene 0"

The Taming of the Shrew
-----------------------
Prolog, Scene 1: Before an alehouse on a heath:
- say: "Go to Act 0, Scene 1"

Prolog, Scene 2: A bedchamber in the Lord's house:
- say: "Go to Act 0, Scene 2"

For specifics on each play, read the file _notes.txt in corresponding folder.
