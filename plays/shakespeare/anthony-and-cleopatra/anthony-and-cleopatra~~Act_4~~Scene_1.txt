          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 1

SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
  Direction: Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
        1  He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
        2  To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
        3  He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
        4  Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
        5  I have many other ways to die; meantime
        6  Laugh at his challenge.
    MECAENAS
        7  Caesar must think,
        8  When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
        9  Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
       10  Make boot of his distraction: never anger
       11  Made good guard for itself.
    OCTAVIUS CAESAR
       12  Let our best heads
       13  Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
       14  We mean to fight: within our files there are,
       15  Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
       16  Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
       17  And feast the army; we have store to do't,
       18  And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!
  Direction: Exeunt
