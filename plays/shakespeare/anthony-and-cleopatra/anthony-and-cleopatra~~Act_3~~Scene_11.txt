          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 11

SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
  Direction: Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants
    MARK ANTONY
        1  Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
        2  It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
        3  I am so lated in the world, that I
        4  Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
        5  Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
        6  And make your peace with Caesar.
    All
        7  Fly! not we.
    MARK ANTONY
        8  I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
        9  To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
       10  I have myself resolved upon a course
       11  Which has no need of you; be gone:
       12  My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
       13  I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
       14  My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
       15  Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
       16  For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
       17  Have letters from me to some friends that will
       18  Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
       19  Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
       20  Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
       21  Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
       22  I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
       23  Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
       24  Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
       25  Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.
  Direction: Sits down
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following
    EROS
       26  Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.
    IRAS
       27  Do, most dear queen.
    CHARMIAN
       28  Do! why: what else?
    CLEOPATRA
       29  Let me sit down. O Juno!
    MARK ANTONY
       30  No, no, no, no, no.
    EROS
       31  See you here, sir?
    MARK ANTONY
       32  O fie, fie, fie!
    CHARMIAN
       33  Madam!
    IRAS
       34  Madam, O good empress!
    EROS
       35  Sir, sir,--
    MARK ANTONY
       36  Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
       37  His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
       38  The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
       39  That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
       40  Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
       41  In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.
    CLEOPATRA
       42  Ah, stand by.
    EROS
       43  The queen, my lord, the queen.
    IRAS
       44  Go to him, madam, speak to him:
       45  He is unqualitied with very shame.
    CLEOPATRA
       46  Well then, sustain him: O!
    EROS
       47  Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
       48  Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
       49  Your comfort makes the rescue.
    MARK ANTONY
       50  I have offended reputation,
       51  A most unnoble swerving.
    EROS
       52  Sir, the queen.
    MARK ANTONY
       53  O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
       54  How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
       55  By looking back what I have left behind
       56  'Stroy'd in dishonour.
    CLEOPATRA
       57  O my lord, my lord,
       58  Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
       59  You would have follow'd.
    MARK ANTONY
       60  Egypt, thou knew'st too well
       61  My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
       62  And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
       63  Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
       64  Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
       65  Command me.
    CLEOPATRA
       66  O, my pardon!
    MARK ANTONY
       67  Now I must
       68  To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
       69  And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
       70  With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
       71  Making and marring fortunes. You did know
       72  How much you were my conqueror; and that
       73  My sword, made weak by my affection, would
       74  Obey it on all cause.
    CLEOPATRA
       75  Pardon, pardon!
    MARK ANTONY
       76  Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
       77  All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
       78  Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
       79  Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
       80  Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
       81  We scorn her most when most she offers blows.
  Direction: Exeunt
