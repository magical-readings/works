          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 3 : Scene 1

SCENE I. A plain in Syria.
  Direction: Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him
    VENTIDIUS
        1  Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
        2  Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
        3  Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
        4  Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
        5  Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
    SILIUS
        6  Noble Ventidius,
        7  Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
        8  The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
        9  Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
       10  The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
       11  Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
       12  Put garlands on thy head.
    VENTIDIUS
       13  O Silius, Silius,
       14  I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
       15  May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
       16  Better to leave undone, than by our deed
       17  Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
       18  Caesar and Antony have ever won
       19  More in their officer than person: Sossius,
       20  One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
       21  For quick accumulation of renown,
       22  Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
       23  Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
       24  Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
       25  The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
       26  Than gain which darkens him.
       27  I could do more to do Antonius good,
       28  But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
       29  Should my performance perish.
    SILIUS
       30  Thou hast, Ventidius,
       31  that
       32  Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
       33  Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
    VENTIDIUS
       34  I'll humbly signify what in his name,
       35  That magical word of war, we have effected;
       36  How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
       37  The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
       38  We have jaded out o' the field.
    SILIUS
       39  Where is he now?
    VENTIDIUS
       40  He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
       41  The weight we must convey with's will permit,
       42  We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!
  Direction: Exeunt
