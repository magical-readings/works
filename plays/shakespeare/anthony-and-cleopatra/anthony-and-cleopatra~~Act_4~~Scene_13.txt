          Anthony And Cleopatra : Act 4 : Scene 13

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.
  Direction: Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN
    CLEOPATRA
        1  Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
        2  Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
        3  Was never so emboss'd.
    CHARMIAN
        4  To the monument!
        5  There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
        6  The soul and body rive not more in parting
        7  Than greatness going off.
    CLEOPATRA
        8  To the monument!
        9  Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
       10  Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
       11  And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
       12  And bring me how he takes my death.
       13  To the monument!
  Direction: Exeunt
